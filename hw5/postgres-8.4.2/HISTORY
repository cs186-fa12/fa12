                                Release Notes

   The release notes contain the significant changes in each PostgreSQL
   release, with major features and migration issues listed at the top.
   The release notes do not contain changes that affect only a few users
   or changes that are internal and therefore not user-visible. For
   example, the optimizer is improved in almost every release, but the
   improvements are usually observed by users as simply faster queries.

   A complete list of changes for each release can be obtained by viewing
   the CVS logs for each release. The pgsql-committers email list records
   all source code changes as well. There is also a web interface that
   shows changes to specific files.

   The name appearing next to each item represents the major developer for
   that item. Of course all changes involve community discussion and patch
   review, so each item is truly a community effort.

                                Release 8.4.2

     Release date: 2009-12-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.4.1. For information
   about new features in the 8.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.4.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.4.X. However, if you
   have any hash indexes, you should "REINDEX" them after updating to
   8.4.2, to repair possible damage.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
       changing session-local state (Gurjeet Singh, Tom)
       This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions from
       possibly subverting a superuser's session (CVE-2009-4136).
     * Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
       common name (CN) field (Magnus)
       This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a server or
       client name during SSL validation (CVE-2009-4034).
     * Fix hash index corruption (Tom)
       The 8.4 change that made hash indexes keep entries sorted by hash
       value failed to update the bucket splitting and compaction routines
       to preserve the ordering. So application of either of those
       operations could lead to permanent corruption of an index, in the
       sense that searches might fail to find entries that are present. To
       deal with this, it is recommended to REINDEX any hash indexes you
       may have after installing this update.
     * Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization
       (Tom)
     * Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary (Tom)
     * Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)
       This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's
       already committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
       if a plain VACUUM is interrupted after having truncated the table.
     * Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
       calculation (Tom)
       This could occur with extremely large planner estimates for the
       size of a hashjoin's result.
     * Fix crash if a DROP is attempted on an internally-dependent object
       (Tom)
     * Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons (Chris Mikkelson)
     * Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared transactions
       are not ignored (Heikki)
     * Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
       accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
     * Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a new CSV
       logfile (Tom)
     * Fix memory leak in postmaster when re-parsing "pg_hba.conf" (Tom)
     * Fix Windows permission-downgrade logic (Jesse Morris)
       This fixes some cases where the database failed to start on
       Windows, often with misleading error messages such as "could not
       locate matching postgres executable".
     * Make FOR UPDATE/SHARE in the primary query not propagate into WITH
       queries (Tom)
       For example, in
WITH w AS (SELECT * FROM foo) SELECT * FROM w, bar ... FOR UPDATE
       the FOR UPDATE will now affect bar but not foo. This is more useful
       and consistent than the original 8.4 behavior, which tried to
       propagate FOR UPDATE into the WITH query but always failed due to
       assorted implementation restrictions. It also follows the design
       rule that WITH queries are executed as if independent of the main
       query.
     * Fix bug with a WITH RECURSIVE query immediately inside another one
       (Tom)
     * Fix concurrency bug in hash indexes (Tom)
       Concurrent insertions could cause index scans to transiently report
       wrong results.
     * Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the split
       depends on a non-first column of the index (Paul Ramsey)
     * Fix wrong search results for a multi-column GIN index with
       fastupdate enabled (Teodor)
     * Fix bugs in WAL entry creation for GIN indexes (Tom)
       These bugs were masked when full_page_writes was on, but with it
       off a WAL replay failure was certain if a crash occurred before the
       next checkpoint.
     * Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file fails at
       the end of checkpoint (Heikki)
       It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and allow the
       checkpoint to complete. Future checkpoints will retry the removal.
       Such problems are not expected in normal operation, but have been
       seen to be caused by misdesigned Windows anti-virus and backup
       software.
     * Ensure WAL files aren't repeatedly archived on Windows (Heikki)
       This is another symptom that could happen if some other process
       interfered with deletion of a no-longer-needed file.
     * Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)
       The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
       Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
       domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
       was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
       stack would pass to it.
     * Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket) size in
       GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods (Ian Turner)
       While the old 2000-byte limit was more than enough for Unix
       Kerberos implementations, tickets issued by Windows Domain
       Controllers can be much larger.
     * Ensure that domain constraints are enforced in constructs like
       ARRAY[...]::domain, where the domain is over an array type (Heikki)
     * Fix foreign-key logic for some cases involving composite-type
       columns as foreign keys (Tom)
     * Ensure that a cursor's snapshot is not modified after it is created
       (Alvaro)
       This could lead to a cursor delivering wrong results if later
       operations in the same transaction modify the data the cursor is
       supposed to return.
     * Fix CREATE TABLE to properly merge default expressions coming from
       different inheritance parent tables (Tom)
       This used to work but was broken in 8.4.
     * Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences (Akira
       Kurosawa)
       This used to work but was broken in 8.3.
     * Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
       FUNCTION (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect handling of WHERE "x"="x" conditions (Tom)
       In some cases these could get ignored as redundant, but they aren't
       -- they're equivalent to "x" IS NOT NULL.
     * Fix incorrect plan construction when using hash aggregation to
       implement DISTINCT for textually identical volatile expressions
       (Tom)
     * Fix Assert failure for a volatile SELECT DISTINCT ON expression
       (Tom)
     * Fix ts_stat() to not fail on an empty tsvector value (Tom)
     * Make text search parser accept underscores in XML attributes
       (Peter)
     * Fix encoding handling in xml binary input (Heikki)
       If the XML header doesn't specify an encoding, we now assume UTF-8
       by default; the previous handling was inconsistent.
     * Fix bug with calling plperl from plperlu or vice versa (Tom)
       An error exit from the inner function could result in crashes due
       to failure to re-select the correct Perl interpreter for the outer
       function.
     * Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function is
       redefined (Tom)
     * Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL arrays
       when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function (Andrew Dunstan,
       Abhijit Menon-Sen)
       This worked correctly already for non-set-returning functions.
     * Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python (Peter)
     * Fix ecpg problem with comments in DECLARE CURSOR statements
       (Michael)
     * Fix ecpg to not treat recently-added keywords as reserved words
       (Tom)
       This affected the keywords CALLED, CATALOG, DEFINER, ENUM,
       FOLLOWING, INVOKER, OPTIONS, PARTITION, PRECEDING, RANGE, SECURITY,
       SERVER, UNBOUNDED, and WRAPPER.
     * Re-allow regular expression special characters in psql's \df
       function name parameter (Tom)
     * In "contrib/pg_standby", disable triggering failover with a signal
       on Windows (Fujii Masao)
       This never did anything useful, because Windows doesn't have
       Unix-style signals, but recent changes made it actually crash.
     * Put FREEZE and VERBOSE options in the right order in the VACUUM
       command that "contrib/vacuumdb" produces (Heikki)
     * Fix possible leak of connections when "contrib/dblink" encounters
       an error (Tatsuhito Kasahara)
     * Ensure psql's flex module is compiled with the correct system
       header definitions (Tom)
       This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile
       causes incompatible changes in the generated code.
     * Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
       connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
       libpq versions (Tom)
     * Update the timezone abbreviation files to match current reality
       (Joachim Wieland)
       This includes adding IDT to the default timezone abbreviation set.
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
       changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji, Novokuznetsk,
       Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also historical corrections for
       Hong Kong.

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix WAL page header initialization at the end of archive recovery
       (Heikki)
       This could lead to failure to process the WAL in a subsequent
       archive recovery.
     * Fix "cannot make new WAL entries during recovery" error (Tom)
     * Fix problem that could make expired rows visible after a crash
       (Tom)
       This bug involved a page status bit potentially not being set
       correctly after a server crash.
     * Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)
       This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch that
       disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions. (See CVE-2007-6600)
     * Make "LOAD" of an already-loaded loadable module into a no-op (Tom)
       Formerly, "LOAD" would attempt to unload and re-load the module,
       but this is unsafe and not all that useful.
     * Make window function PARTITION BY and ORDER BY items always be
       interpreted as simple expressions (Tom)
       In 8.4.0 these lists were parsed following the rules used for
       top-level GROUP BY and ORDER BY lists. But this was not correct per
       the SQL standard, and it led to possible circularity.
     * Fix several errors in planning of semi-joins (Tom)
       These led to wrong query results in some cases where IN or EXISTS
       was used together with another join.
     * Fix handling of whole-row references to subqueries that are within
       an outer join (Tom)
       An example is SELECT COUNT(ss.*) FROM ... LEFT JOIN (SELECT ...) ss
       ON .... Here, ss.* would be treated as ROW(NULL,NULL,...) for
       null-extended join rows, which is not the same as a simple NULL.
       Now it is treated as a simple NULL.
     * Fix Windows shared-memory allocation code (Tsutomu Yamada, Magnus)
       This bug led to the often-reported "could not reattach to shared
       memory" error message.
     * Fix locale handling with plperl (Heikki)
       This bug could cause the server's locale setting to change when a
       plperl function is called, leading to data corruption.
     * Fix handling of reloptions to ensure setting one option doesn't
       force default values for others (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Ensure that a "fast shutdown" request will forcibly terminate open
       sessions, even if a "smart shutdown" was already in progress (Fujii
       Masao)
     * Avoid memory leak for array_agg() in GROUP BY queries (Tom)
     * Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
       'HH'/'HH12' (Heikki)
       It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
     * Include the fractional part in the result of EXTRACT(second) and
       EXTRACT(milliseconds) for time and time with time zone inputs (Tom)
       This has always worked for floating-point datetime configurations,
       but was broken in the integer datetime code.
     * Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
       and integer datetimes are in use (Alex Hunsaker)
     * Improve performance when processing toasted values in index scans
       (Tom)
       This is particularly useful for PostGIS.
     * Fix a typo that disabled commit_delay (Jeff Janes)
     * Output early-startup messages to "postmaster.log" if the server is
       started in silent mode (Tom)
       Previously such error messages were discarded, leading to
       difficulty in debugging.
     * Remove translated FAQs (Peter)
       They are now on the wiki. The main FAQ was moved to the wiki some
       time ago.
     * Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
       empty (Jeff Davis)
     * Fix several errors in pg_dump's --binary-upgrade mode (Bruce, Tom)
       pg_dump --binary-upgrade is used by pg_migrator.
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
       number of parameters (twenty) (Tom)
     * Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
       "COPY FROM STDIN" (Tom)
     * Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
       both libraries are installed (Zdenek Kotala)
     * Work around gcc bug that causes "floating-point exception" instead
       of "division by zero" on some platforms (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009l for DST law
       changes in Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius.

                                 Release 8.4

     Release date: 2009-07-01
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   After many years of development, PostgreSQL has become feature-complete
   in many areas. This release shows a targeted approach to adding
   features (e.g., authentication, monitoring, space reuse), and adds
   capabilities defined in the later SQL standards. The major areas of
   enhancement are:

     * Windowing Functions
     * Common Table Expressions and Recursive Queries
     * Default and variadic parameters for functions
     * Parallel Restore
     * Column Permissions
     * Per-database locale settings
     * Improved hash indexes
     * Improved join performance for EXISTS and NOT EXISTS queries
     * Easier-to-use Warm Standby
     * Automatic sizing of the Free Space Map
     * Visibility Map (greatly reduces vacuum overhead for slowly-changing
       tables)
     * Version-aware psql (backslash commands work against older servers)
     * Support SSL certificates for user authentication
     * Per-function runtime statistics
     * Easy editing of functions in psql
     * New contrib modules: pg_stat_statements, auto_explain, citext,
       btree_gin

   The above items are explained in more detail in the sections below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.4

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:
     __________________________________________________________________

General

     * Use 64-bit integer datetimes by default (Neil Conway)
       Previously this was selected by configure's
       "--enable-integer-datetimes" option. To retain the old behavior,
       build with "--disable-integer-datetimes".
     * Remove ipcclean utility command (Bruce)
       The utility only worked on a few platforms. Users should use their
       operating system tools instead.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Settings

     * Change default setting for log_min_messages to warning (previously
       it was notice) to reduce log file volume (Tom)
     * Change default setting for max_prepared_transactions to zero
       (previously it was 5) (Tom)
     * Make debug_print_parse, debug_print_rewritten, and debug_print_plan
       output appear at LOG message level, not DEBUG1 as formerly (Tom)
     * Make debug_pretty_print default to on (Tom)
     * Remove explain_pretty_print parameter (no longer needed) (Tom)
     * Make log_temp_files settable by superusers only, like other logging
       options (Simon Riggs)
     * Remove automatic appending of the epoch timestamp when no % escapes
       are present in log_filename (Robert Haas)
       This change was made because some users wanted a fixed log
       filename, for use with an external log rotation tool.
     * Remove log_restartpoints from "recovery.conf"; instead use
       log_checkpoints (Simon)
     * Remove krb_realm and krb_server_hostname; these are now set in
       "pg_hba.conf" instead (Magnus)
     * There are also significant changes in "pg_hba.conf", as described
       below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Queries

     * Change "TRUNCATE" and "LOCK" to apply to child tables of the
       specified table(s) (Peter)
       These commands now accept an ONLY option that prevents processing
       child tables; this option must be used if the old behavior is
       needed.
     * "SELECT DISTINCT" and UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT no longer always
       produce sorted output (Tom)
       Previously, these types of queries always removed duplicate rows by
       means of Sort/Unique processing (i.e., sort then remove adjacent
       duplicates). Now they can be implemented by hashing, which will not
       produce sorted output. If an application relied on the output being
       in sorted order, the recommended fix is to add an ORDER BY clause.
       As a short-term workaround, the previous behavior can be restored
       by disabling enable_hashagg, but that is a very
       performance-expensive fix. SELECT DISTINCT ON never uses hashing,
       however, so its behavior is unchanged.
     * Force child tables to inherit CHECK constraints from parents (Alex
       Hunsaker, Nikhil Sontakke, Tom)
       Formerly it was possible to drop such a constraint from a child
       table, allowing rows that violate the constraint to be visible when
       scanning the parent table. This was deemed inconsistent, as well as
       contrary to SQL standard.
     * Disallow negative LIMIT or OFFSET values, rather than treating them
       as zero (Simon)
     * Disallow "LOCK TABLE" outside a transaction block (Tom)
       Such an operation is useless because the lock would be released
       immediately.
     * Sequences now contain an additional start_value column (Zoltan
       Boszormenyi)
       This supports "ALTER SEQUENCE ... RESTART".
     __________________________________________________________________

Functions and Operators

     * Make numeric zero raised to a fractional power return 0, rather
       than throwing an error, and make numeric zero raised to the zero
       power return 1, rather than error (Bruce)
       This matches the longstanding float8 behavior.
     * Allow unary minus of floating-point values to produce minus zero
       (Tom)
       The changed behavior is more IEEE-standard compliant.
     * Throw an error if an escape character is the last character in a
       LIKE pattern (i.e., it has nothing to escape) (Tom)
       Previously, such an escape character was silently ignored, thus
       possibly masking application logic errors.
     * Remove ~=~ and ~<>~ operators formerly used for LIKE index
       comparisons (Tom)
       Pattern indexes now use the regular equality operator.
     * xpath() now passes its arguments to libxml without any changes
       (Andrew)
       This means that the XML argument must be a well-formed XML
       document. The previous coding attempted to allow XML fragments, but
       it did not work well.
     * Make xmlelement() format attribute values just like content values
       (Peter)
       Previously, attribute values were formatted according to the normal
       SQL output behavior, which is sometimes at odds with XML rules.
     * Rewrite memory management for libxml-using functions (Tom)
       This change should avoid some compatibility problems with use of
       libxml in PL/Perl and other add-on code.
     * Adopt a faster algorithm for hash functions (Kenneth Marshall,
       based on work of Bob Jenkins)
       Many of the built-in hash functions now deliver different results
       on little-endian and big-endian platforms.
     __________________________________________________________________

Temporal Functions and Operators

     * DateStyle no longer controls interval output formatting; instead
       there is a new variable IntervalStyle (Ron Mayer)
     * Improve consistency of handling of fractional seconds in timestamp
       and interval output (Ron Mayer)
       This may result in displaying a different number of fractional
       digits than before, or rounding instead of truncating.
     * Make to_char()'s localized month/day names depend on LC_TIME, not
       LC_MESSAGES (Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     * Cause to_date() and to_timestamp() to more consistently report
       errors for invalid input (Brendan Jurd)
       Previous versions would often ignore or silently misread input that
       did not match the format string. Such cases will now result in an
       error.
     * Fix to_timestamp() to not require upper/lower case matching for
       meridian (AM/PM) and era (BC/AD) format designations (Brendan Jurd)
       For example, input value ad now matches the format string AD.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the changes between
   PostgreSQL 8.4 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance

     * Improve optimizer statistics calculations (Jan Urbanski, Tom)
       In particular, estimates for full-text-search operators are greatly
       improved.
     * Allow "SELECT DISTINCT" and UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT to use hashing
       (Tom)
       This means that these types of queries no longer automatically
       produce sorted output.
     * Create explicit concepts of semi-joins and anti-joins (Tom)
       This work formalizes our previous ad-hoc treatment of IN (SELECT
       ...) clauses, and extends it to EXISTS and NOT EXISTS clauses. It
       should result in significantly better planning of EXISTS and NOT
       EXISTS queries. In general, logically equivalent IN and EXISTS
       clauses should now have similar performance, whereas previously IN
       often won.
     * Improve optimization of sub-selects beneath outer joins (Tom)
       Formerly, a sub-select or view could not be optimized very well if
       it appeared within the nullable side of an outer join and contained
       non-strict expressions (for instance, constants) in its result
       list.
     * Improve the performance of text_position() and related functions by
       using Boyer-Moore-Horspool searching (David Rowley)
       This is particularly helpful for long search patterns.
     * Reduce I/O load of writing the statistics collection file by
       writing the file only when requested (Martin Pihlak)
     * Improve performance for bulk inserts (Robert Haas, Simon)
     * Increase the default value of default_statistics_target from 10 to
       100 (Greg Sabino Mullane, Tom)
       The maximum value was also increased from 1000 to 10000.
     * Perform constraint_exclusion checking by default in queries
       involving inheritance or UNION ALL (Tom)
       A new constraint_exclusion setting, partition, was added to specify
       this behavior.
     * Allow I/O read-ahead for bitmap index scans (Greg Stark)
       The amount of read-ahead is controlled by effective_io_concurrency.
       This feature is available only if the kernel has posix_fadvise()
       support.
     * Inline simple set-returning SQL functions in FROM clauses (Richard
       Rowell)
     * Improve performance of multi-batch hash joins by providing a
       special case for join key values that are especially common in the
       outer relation (Bryce Cutt, Ramon Lawrence)
     * Reduce volume of temporary data in multi-batch hash joins by
       suppressing "physical tlist" optimization (Michael Henderson, Ramon
       Lawrence)
     * Avoid waiting for idle-in-transaction sessions during "CREATE INDEX
       CONCURRENTLY" (Simon)
     * Improve performance of shared cache invalidation (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server

Settings

     * Convert many "postgresql.conf" settings to enumerated values so
       that pg_settings can display the valid values (Magnus)
     * Add cursor_tuple_fraction parameter to control the fraction of a
       cursor's rows that the planner assumes will be fetched (Robert
       Hell)
     * Allow underscores in the names of custom variable classes in
       "postgresql.conf" (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Authentication and security

     * Remove support for the (insecure) crypt authentication method
       (Magnus)
       This effectively obsoletes pre-PostgreSQL 7.2 client libraries, as
       there is no longer any non-plaintext password method that they can
       use.
     * Support regular expressions in "pg_ident.conf" (Magnus)
     * Allow Kerberos/GSSAPI parameters to be changed without restarting
       the postmaster (Magnus)
     * Support SSL certificate chains in server certificate file (Andrew
       Gierth)
       Including the full certificate chain makes the client able to
       verify the certificate without having all intermediate CA
       certificates present in the local store, which is often the case
       for commercial CAs.
     * Report appropriate error message for combination of MD5
       authentication and db_user_namespace enabled (Bruce)
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_hba.conf

     * Change all authentication options to use name=value syntax (Magnus)
       This makes incompatible changes to the ldap, pam and ident
       authentication methods. All "pg_hba.conf" entries with these
       methods need to be rewritten using the new format.
     * Remove the ident sameuser option, instead making that behavior the
       default if no usermap is specified (Magnus)
     * Allow a usermap parameter for all external authentication methods
       (Magnus)
       Previously a usermap was only supported for ident authentication.
     * Add clientcert option to control requesting of a client certificate
       (Magnus)
       Previously this was controlled by the presence of a root
       certificate file in the server's data directory.
     * Add cert authentication method to allow *user* authentication via
       SSL certificates (Magnus)
       Previously SSL certificates could only verify that the client had
       access to a certificate, not authenticate a user.
     * Allow krb5, gssapi and sspi realm and krb5 host settings to be
       specified in "pg_hba.conf" (Magnus)
       These override the settings in "postgresql.conf".
     * Add include_realm parameter for krb5, gssapi, and sspi methods
       (Magnus)
       This allows identical usernames from different realms to be
       authenticated as different database users using usermaps.
     * Parse "pg_hba.conf" fully when it is loaded, so that errors are
       reported immediately (Magnus)
       Previously, most errors in the file wouldn't be detected until
       clients tried to connect, so an erroneous file could render the
       system unusable. With the new behavior, if an error is detected
       during reload then the bad file is rejected and the postmaster
       continues to use its old copy.
     * Show all parsing errors in "pg_hba.conf" instead of aborting after
       the first one (Selena Deckelmann)
     * Support ident authentication over Unix-domain sockets on Solaris
       (Garick Hamlin)
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuous Archiving

     * Provide an option to pg_start_backup() to force its implied
       checkpoint to finish as quickly as possible (Tom)
       The default behavior avoids excess I/O consumption, but that is
       pointless if no concurrent query activity is going on.
     * Make pg_stop_backup() wait for modified WAL files to be archived
       (Simon)
       This guarantees that the backup is valid at the time
       pg_stop_backup() completes.
     * When archiving is enabled, rotate the last WAL segment at shutdown
       so that all transactions can be archived immediately (Guillaume
       Smet, Heikki)
     * Delay "smart" shutdown while a continuous archiving base backup is
       in progress (Laurenz Albe)
     * Cancel a continuous archiving base backup if "fast" shutdown is
       requested (Laurenz Albe)
     * Allow "recovery.conf" boolean variables to take the same range of
       string values as "postgresql.conf" boolean variables (Bruce)
     __________________________________________________________________

Monitoring

     * Add pg_conf_load_time() to report when the PostgreSQL configuration
       files were last loaded (George Gensure)
     * Add pg_terminate_backend() to safely terminate a backend (the
       SIGTERM signal works also) (Tom, Bruce)
       While it's always been possible to SIGTERM a single backend, this
       was previously considered unsupported; and testing of the case
       found some bugs that are now fixed.
     * Add ability to track user-defined functions' call counts and
       runtimes (Martin Pihlak)
       Function statistics appear in a new system view,
       pg_stat_user_functions. Tracking is controlled by the new parameter
       track_functions.
     * Allow specification of the maximum query string size in
       pg_stat_activity via new track_activity_query_size parameter
       (Thomas Lee)
     * Increase the maximum line length sent to syslog, in hopes of
       improving performance (Tom)
     * Add read-only configuration variables segment_size, wal_block_size,
       and wal_segment_size (Bernd Helmle)
     * When reporting a deadlock, report the text of all queries involved
       in the deadlock to the server log (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Add pg_stat_get_activity(pid) function to return information about
       a specific process id (Magnus)
     * Allow the location of the server's statistics file to be specified
       via stats_temp_directory (Magnus)
       This allows the statistics file to be placed in a RAM-resident
       directory to reduce I/O requirements. On startup/shutdown, the file
       is copied to its traditional location ($PGDATA/global/) so it is
       preserved across restarts.
     __________________________________________________________________

Queries

     * Add support for WINDOW functions (Hitoshi Harada)
     * Add support for WITH clauses (CTEs), including WITH RECURSIVE
       (Yoshiyuki Asaba, Tatsuo Ishii, Tom)
     * Add "TABLE" command (Peter)
       TABLE tablename is a SQL standard short-hand for SELECT * FROM
       tablename.
     * Allow AS to be optional when specifying a "SELECT" (or RETURNING)
       column output label (Hiroshi Saito)
       This works so long as the column label is not any PostgreSQL
       keyword; otherwise AS is still needed.
     * Support set-returning functions in "SELECT" result lists even for
       functions that return their result via a tuplestore (Tom)
       In particular, this means that functions written in PL/PgSQL and
       other PL languages can now be called this way.
     * Support set-returning functions in the output of aggregation and
       grouping queries (Tom)
     * Allow "SELECT FOR UPDATE"/SHARE to work on inheritance trees (Tom)
     * Add infrastructure for SQL/MED (Martin Pihlak, Peter)
       There are no remote or external SQL/MED capabilities yet, but this
       change provides a standardized and future-proof system for managing
       connection information for modules like "dblink" and "plproxy".
     * Invalidate cached plans when referenced schemas, functions,
       operators, or operator classes are modified (Martin Pihlak, Tom)
       This improves the system's ability to respond to on-the-fly DDL
       changes.
     * Allow comparison of composite types and allow arrays of anonymous
       composite types (Tom)
       This allows constructs such as row(1, 1.1) = any (array[row(7,
       7.7), row(1, 1.0)]). This is particularly useful in recursive
       queries.
     * Add support for Unicode string literal and identifier
       specifications using code points, e.g. U&'d\0061t\+000061' (Peter)
     * Reject \000 in string literals and "COPY" data (Tom)
       Previously, this was accepted but had the effect of terminating the
       string contents.
     * Improve the parser's ability to report error locations (Tom)
       An error location is now reported for many semantic errors, such as
       mismatched datatypes, that previously could not be localized.
     __________________________________________________________________

TRUNCATE

     * Support statement-level ON TRUNCATE triggers (Simon)
     * Add RESTART/CONTINUE IDENTITY options for "TRUNCATE TABLE" (Zoltan
       Boszormenyi)
       The start value of a sequence can be changed by "ALTER SEQUENCE
       START WITH".
     * Allow "TRUNCATE tab1, tab1" to succeed (Bruce)
     * Add a separate "TRUNCATE" permission (Robert Haas)
     __________________________________________________________________

EXPLAIN

     * Make "EXPLAIN VERBOSE" show the output columns of each plan node
       (Tom)
       Previously "EXPLAIN VERBOSE" output an internal representation of
       the query plan. (That behavior is now available via
       debug_print_plan.)
     * Make "EXPLAIN" identify subplans and initplans with individual
       labels (Tom)
     * Make "EXPLAIN" honor debug_print_plan (Tom)
     * Allow "EXPLAIN" on "CREATE TABLE AS" (Peter)
     __________________________________________________________________

LIMIT/OFFSET

     * Allow sub-selects in LIMIT and OFFSET (Tom)
     * Add SQL-standard syntax for LIMIT/OFFSET capabilities (Peter)
       To wit, OFFSET num {ROW|ROWS} FETCH {FIRST|NEXT} [num] {ROW|ROWS}
       ONLY.
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation

     * Add support for column-level privileges (Stephen Frost, KaiGai
       Kohei)
     * Refactor multi-object "DROP" operations to reduce the need for
       CASCADE (Alex Hunsaker)
       For example, if table B has a dependency on table A, the command
       DROP TABLE A, B no longer requires the CASCADE option.
     * Fix various problems with concurrent "DROP" commands by ensuring
       that locks are taken before we begin to drop dependencies of an
       object (Tom)
     * Improve reporting of dependencies during "DROP" commands (Tom)
     * Add WITH [NO] DATA clause to "CREATE TABLE AS", per the SQL
       standard (Peter, Tom)
     * Add support for user-defined I/O conversion casts (Heikki)
     * Allow "CREATE AGGREGATE" to use an internal transition datatype
       (Tom)
     * Add LIKE clause to "CREATE TYPE" (Tom)
       This simplifies creation of data types that use the same internal
       representation as an existing type.
     * Allow specification of the type category and "preferred" status for
       user-defined base types (Tom)
       This allows more control over the coercion behavior of user-defined
       types.
     * Allow "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW" to add columns to the end of a view
       (Robert Haas)
     __________________________________________________________________

ALTER

     * Add "ALTER TYPE RENAME" (Petr Jelinek)
     * Add "ALTER SEQUENCE ... RESTART" (with no parameter) to reset a
       sequence to its initial value (Zoltan Boszormenyi)
     * Modify the "ALTER TABLE" syntax to allow all reasonable
       combinations for tables, indexes, sequences, and views (Tom)
       This change allows the following new syntaxes:
          + "ALTER SEQUENCE OWNER TO"
          + "ALTER VIEW ALTER COLUMN SET/DROP DEFAULT"
          + "ALTER VIEW OWNER TO"
          + "ALTER VIEW SET SCHEMA"
       There is no actual new functionality here, but formerly you had to
       say "ALTER TABLE" to do these things, which was confusing.
     * Add support for the syntax "ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET
       DATA TYPE" (Peter)
       This is SQL-standard syntax for functionality that was already
       supported.
     * Make "ALTER TABLE SET WITHOUT OIDS" rewrite the table to physically
       remove OID values (Tom)
       Also, add "ALTER TABLE SET WITH OIDS" to rewrite the table to add
       OIDs.
     __________________________________________________________________

Database Manipulation

     * Improve reporting of "CREATE"/"DROP"/"RENAME DATABASE" failure when
       uncommitted prepared transactions are the cause (Tom)
     * Make LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE into per-database settings (Radek
       Strnad, Heikki)
       This makes collation similar to encoding, which was always
       configurable per database.
     * Improve checks that the database encoding, collation (LC_COLLATE),
       and character classes (LC_CTYPE) match (Heikki, Tom)
       Note in particular that a new database's encoding and locale
       settings can be changed only when copying from template0. This
       prevents possibly copying data that doesn't match the settings.
     * Add "ALTER DATABASE SET TABLESPACE" to move a database to a new
       tablespace (Guillaume Lelarge, Bernd Helmle)
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Operations

     * Add a VERBOSE option to the "CLUSTER" command and clusterdb (Jim
       Cox)
     * Decrease memory requirements for recording pending trigger events
       (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Indexes

     * Dramatically improve the speed of building and accessing hash
       indexes (Tom Raney, Shreya Bhargava)
       This allows hash indexes to be sometimes faster than btree indexes.
       However, hash indexes are still not crash-safe.
     * Make hash indexes store only the hash code, not the full value of
       the indexed column (Xiao Meng)
       This greatly reduces the size of hash indexes for long indexed
       values, improving performance.
     * Implement fast update option for GIN indexes (Teodor, Oleg)
       This option greatly improves update speed at a small penalty in
       search speed.
     * xxx_pattern_ops indexes can now be used for simple equality
       comparisons, not only for LIKE (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Full Text Indexes

     * Remove the requirement to use @@@ when doing GIN weighted lookups
       on full text indexes (Tom, Teodor)
       The normal @@ text search operator can be used instead.
     * Add an optimizer selectivity function for @@ text search operations
       (Jan Urbanski)
     * Allow prefix matching in full text searches (Teodor Sigaev, Oleg
       Bartunov)
     * Support multi-column GIN indexes (Teodor Sigaev)
     * Improve support for Nepali language and Devanagari alphabet
       (Teodor)
     __________________________________________________________________

VACUUM

     * Track free space in separate per-relation "fork" files (Heikki)
       Free space discovered by "VACUUM" is now recorded in "*_fsm" files,
       rather than in a fixed-sized shared memory area. The max_fsm_pages
       and max_fsm_relations settings have been removed, greatly
       simplifying administration of free space management.
     * Add a visibility map to track pages that do not require vacuuming
       (Heikki)
       This allows "VACUUM" to avoid scanning all of a table when only a
       portion of the table needs vacuuming. The visibility map is stored
       in per-relation "fork" files.
     * Add vacuum_freeze_table_age parameter to control when "VACUUM"
       should ignore the visibility map and do a full table scan to freeze
       tuples (Heikki)
     * Track transaction snapshots more carefully (Alvaro)
       This improves "VACUUM"'s ability to reclaim space in the presence
       of long-running transactions.
     * Add ability to specify per-relation autovacuum and TOAST parameters
       in "CREATE TABLE" (Alvaro, Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
       Autovacuum options used to be stored in a system table.
     * Add --freeze option to vacuumdb (Bruce)
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Types

     * Add a CaseSensitive option for text search synonym dictionaries
       (Simon)
     * Improve the precision of NUMERIC division (Tom)
     * Add basic arithmetic operators for int2 with int8 (Tom)
       This eliminates the need for explicit casting in some situations.
     * Allow UUID input to accept an optional hyphen after every fourth
       digit (Robert Haas)
     * Allow on/off as input for the boolean data type (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Allow spaces around NaN in the input string for type numeric (Sam
       Mason)
     __________________________________________________________________

Temporal Data Types

     * Reject year 0 BC and years 000 and 0000 (Tom)
       Previously these were interpreted as 1 BC. (Note: years 0 and 00
       are still assumed to be the year 2000.)
     * Include SGT (Singapore time) in the default list of known time zone
       abbreviations (Tom)
     * Support infinity and -infinity as values of type date (Tom)
     * Make parsing of interval literals more standard-compliant (Tom, Ron
       Mayer)
       For example, INTERVAL '1' YEAR now does what it's supposed to.
     * Allow interval fractional-seconds precision to be specified after
       the second keyword, for SQL standard compliance (Tom)
       Formerly the precision had to be specified after the keyword
       interval. (For backwards compatibility, this syntax is still
       supported, though deprecated.) Data type definitions will now be
       output using the standard format.
     * Support the IS0 8601 interval syntax (Ron Mayer, Kevin Grittner)
       For example, INTERVAL 'P1Y2M3DT4H5M6.7S' is now supported.
     * Add IntervalStyle parameter which controls how interval values are
       output (Ron Mayer)
       Valid values are: postgres, postgres_verbose, sql_standard,
       iso_8601. This setting also controls the handling of negative
       interval input when only some fields have positive/negative
       designations.
     * Improve consistency of handling of fractional seconds in timestamp
       and interval output (Ron Mayer)
     __________________________________________________________________

Arrays

     * Improve the handling of casts applied to ARRAY[] constructs, such
       as ARRAY[...]::integer[] (Brendan Jurd)
       Formerly PostgreSQL attempted to determine a data type for the
       ARRAY[] construct without reference to the ensuing cast. This could
       fail unnecessarily in many cases, in particular when the ARRAY[]
       construct was empty or contained only ambiguous entries such as
       NULL. Now the cast is consulted to determine the type that the
       array elements must be.
     * Make SQL-syntax ARRAY dimensions optional to match the SQL standard
       (Peter)
     * Add array_ndims() to return the number of dimensions of an array
       (Robert Haas)
     * Add array_length() to return the length of an array for a specified
       dimension (Jim Nasby, Robert Haas, Peter Eisentraut)
     * Add aggregate function array_agg(), which returns all aggregated
       values as a single array (Robert Haas, Jeff Davis, Peter)
     * Add unnest(), which converts an array to individual row values
       (Tom)
       This is the opposite of array_agg().
     * Add array_fill() to create arrays initialized with a value (Pavel
       Stehule)
     * Add generate_subscripts() to simplify generating the range of an
       array's subscripts (Pavel Stehule)
     __________________________________________________________________

Wide-Value Storage (TOAST)

     * Consider TOAST compression on values as short as 32 bytes
       (previously 256 bytes) (Greg Stark)
     * Require 25% minimum space savings before using TOAST compression
       (previously 20% for small values and any-savings-at-all for large
       values) (Greg)
     * Improve TOAST heuristics for rows that have a mix of large and
       small toastable fields, so that we prefer to push large values out
       of line and don't compress small values unnecessarily (Greg, Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Functions

     * Document that setseed() allows values from -1 to 1 (not just 0 to
       1), and enforce the valid range (Kris Jurka)
     * Add server-side function lo_import(filename, oid) (Tatsuo)
     * Add quote_nullable(), which behaves like quote_literal() but
       returns the string NULL for a null argument (Brendan Jurd)
     * Improve full text search headline() function to allow extracting
       several fragments of text (Sushant Sinha)
     * Add suppress_redundant_updates_trigger() trigger function to avoid
       overhead for non-data-changing updates (Andrew)
     * Add div(numeric, numeric) to perform numeric division without
       rounding (Tom)
     * Add timestamp and timestamptz versions of generate_series()
       (Hitoshi Harada)
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Information Functions

     * Implement current_query() for use by functions that need to know
       the currently running query (Tomas Doran)
     * Add pg_get_keywords() to return a list of the parser keywords (Dave
       Page)
     * Add pg_get_functiondef() to see a function's definition (Abhijit
       Menon-Sen)
     * Allow the second argument of pg_get_expr() to be zero when
       deparsing an expression that does not contain variables (Tom)
     * Modify pg_relation_size() to use regclass (Heikki)
       pg_relation_size(data_type_name) no longer works.
     * Add boot_val and reset_val columns to pg_settings output (Greg
       Smith)
     * Add source file name and line number columns to pg_settings output
       for variables set in a configuration file (Magnus, Alvaro)
       For security reasons, these columns are only visible to superusers.
     * Add support for CURRENT_CATALOG, CURRENT_SCHEMA, SET CATALOG, SET
       SCHEMA (Peter)
       These provide SQL-standard syntax for existing features.
     * Add pg_typeof() which returns the data type of any value (Brendan
       Jurd)
     * Make version() return information about whether the server is a 32-
       or 64-bit binary (Bruce)
     * Fix the behavior of information schema columns is_insertable_into
       and is_updatable to be consistent (Peter)
     * Improve the behavior of information schema datetime_precision
       columns (Peter)
       These columns now show zero for date columns, and 6 (the default
       precision) for time, timestamp, and interval without a declared
       precision, rather than showing null as formerly.
     * Convert remaining builtin set-returning functions to use OUT
       parameters (Jaime Casanova)
       This makes it possible to call these functions without specifying a
       column list: pg_show_all_settings(), pg_lock_status(),
       pg_prepared_xact(), pg_prepared_statement(), pg_cursor()
     * Make pg_*_is_visible() and has_*_privilege() functions return NULL
       for invalid OIDs, rather than reporting an error (Tom)
     * Extend has_*_privilege() functions to allow inquiring about the OR
       of multiple privileges in one call (Stephen Frost, Tom)
     * Add has_column_privilege() and has_any_column_privilege() functions
       (Stephen Frost, Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Function Creation

     * Support variadic functions (functions with a variable number of
       arguments) (Pavel Stehule)
       Only trailing arguments can be optional, and they all must be of
       the same data type.
     * Support default values for function arguments (Pavel Stehule)
     * Add "CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURNS TABLE" clause (Pavel Stehule)
     * Allow SQL-language functions to return the output of an
       "INSERT"/"UPDATE"/"DELETE" RETURNING clause (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/PgSQL Server-Side Language

     * Support EXECUTE USING for easier insertion of data values into a
       dynamic query string (Pavel Stehule)
     * Allow looping over the results of a cursor using a FOR loop (Pavel
       Stehule)
     * Support RETURN QUERY EXECUTE (Pavel Stehule)
     * Improve the RAISE command (Pavel Stehule)
          + Support DETAIL and HINT fields
          + Support specification of the SQLSTATE error code
          + Support an exception name parameter
          + Allow RAISE without parameters in an exception block to
            re-throw the current error
     * Allow specification of SQLSTATE codes in EXCEPTION lists (Pavel
       Stehule)
       This is useful for handling custom SQLSTATE codes.
     * Support the CASE statement (Pavel Stehule)
     * Make "RETURN QUERY" set the special FOUND and "GET DIAGNOSTICS"
       ROW_COUNT variables (Pavel Stehule)
     * Make "FETCH" and "MOVE" set the "GET DIAGNOSTICS" ROW_COUNT
       variable (Andrew Gierth)
     * Make "EXIT" without a label always exit the innermost loop (Tom)
       Formerly, if there were a BEGIN block more closely nested than any
       loop, it would exit that block instead. The new behavior matches
       Oracle(TM) and is also what was previously stated by our own
       documentation.
     * Make processing of string literals and nested block comments match
       the main SQL parser's processing (Tom)
       In particular, the format string in "RAISE" now works the same as
       any other string literal, including being subject to
       standard_conforming_strings. This change also fixes other cases in
       which valid commands would fail when standard_conforming_strings is
       on.
     * Avoid memory leakage when the same function is called at varying
       exception-block nesting depths (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Client Applications

     * Fix pg_ctl restart to preserve command-line arguments (Bruce)
     * Add -w/--no-password option that prevents password prompting in all
       utilities that have a -W/--password option (Peter)
     * Remove "-q" (quiet) option of createdb, createuser, dropdb,
       dropuser (Peter)
       These options have had no effect since PostgreSQL 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

psql

     * Remove verbose startup banner; now just suggest help (Joshua Drake)
     * Make help show common backslash commands (Greg Sabino Mullane)
     * Add \pset format wrapped mode to wrap output to the screen width,
       or file/pipe output too if \pset columns is set (Bryce Nesbitt)
     * Allow all supported spellings of boolean values in "\pset", rather
       than just on and off (Bruce)
       Formerly, any string other than "off" was silently taken to mean
       true. psql will now complain about unrecognized spellings (but
       still take them as true).
     * Use the pager for wide output (Bruce)
     * Require a space between a one-letter backslash command and its
       first argument (Bernd Helmle)
       This removes a historical source of ambiguity.
     * Improve tab completion support for schema-qualified and quoted
       identifiers (Greg Sabino Mullane)
     * Add optional on/off argument for "\timing" (David Fetter)
     * Display access control rights on multiple lines (Brendan Jurd,
       Andreas Scherbaum)
     * Make "\l" show database access privileges (Andrew Gilligan)
     * Make "\l+" show database sizes, if permissions allow (Andrew
       Gilligan)
     * Add the "\ef" command to edit function definitions (Abhijit
       Menon-Sen)
     __________________________________________________________________

psql \d* commands

     * Make "\d*" commands that do not have a pattern argument show system
       objects only if the S modifier is specified (Greg Sabino Mullane,
       Bruce)
       The former behavior was inconsistent across different variants of
       "\d", and in most cases it provided no easy way to see just user
       objects.
     * Improve "\d*" commands to work with older PostgreSQL server
       versions (back to 7.4), not only the current server version
       (Guillaume Lelarge)
     * Make "\d" show foreign-key constraints that reference the selected
       table (Kenneth D'Souza)
     * Make "\d" on a sequence show its column values (Euler Taveira de
       Oliveira)
     * Add column storage type and other relation options to the "\d+"
       display (Gregory Stark, Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     * Show relation size in "\dt+" output (Dickson S. Guedes)
     * Show the possible values of enum types in "\dT+" (David Fetter)
     * Allow "\dC" to accept a wildcard pattern, which matches either
       datatype involved in the cast (Tom)
     * Add a function type column to "\df"'s output, and add options to
       list only selected types of functions (David Fetter)
     * Make "\df" not hide functions that take or return type cstring
       (Tom)
       Previously, such functions were hidden because most of them are
       datatype I/O functions, which were deemed uninteresting. The new
       policy about hiding system functions by default makes this wart
       unnecessary.
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump

     * Add a --no-tablespaces option to pg_dump/pg_dumpall/pg_restore so
       that dumps can be restored to clusters that have non-matching
       tablespace layouts (Gavin Roy)
     * Remove "-d" and "-D" options from pg_dump and pg_dumpall (Tom)
       These options were too frequently confused with the option to
       select a database name in other PostgreSQL client applications. The
       functionality is still available, but you must now spell out the
       long option name "--inserts" or "--column-inserts".
     * Remove "-i"/"--ignore-version" option from pg_dump and pg_dumpall
       (Tom)
       Use of this option does not throw an error, but it has no effect.
       This option was removed because the version checks are necessary
       for safety.
     * Disable statement_timeout during dump and restore (Joshua Drake)
     * Add pg_dump/pg_dumpall option "--lock-wait-timeout" (David Gould)
       This allows dumps to fail if unable to acquire a shared lock within
       the specified amount of time.
     * Reorder pg_dump --data-only output to dump tables referenced by
       foreign keys before the referencing tables (Tom)
       This allows data loads when foreign keys are already present. If
       circular references make a safe ordering impossible, a NOTICE is
       issued.
     * Allow pg_dump, pg_dumpall, and pg_restore to use a specified role
       (Benedek Lszl)
     * Allow pg_restore to use multiple concurrent connections to do the
       restore (Andrew)
       The number of concurrent connections is controlled by the option
       --jobs. This is supported only for custom-format archives.
     __________________________________________________________________

Programming Tools

libpq

     * Allow the OID to be specified when importing a large object, via
       new function lo_import_with_oid() (Tatsuo)
     * Add "events" support (Andrew Chernow, Merlin Moncure)
       This adds the ability to register callbacks to manage private data
       associated with PGconn and PGresult objects.
     * Improve error handling to allow the return of multiple error
       messages as multi-line error reports (Magnus)
     * Make PQexecParams() and related functions return PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY
       for an empty query (Tom)
       They previously returned PGRES_COMMAND_OK.
     * Document how to avoid the overhead of WSACleanup() on Windows
       (Andrew Chernow)
     * Do not rely on Kerberos tickets to determine the default database
       username (Magnus)
       Previously, a Kerberos-capable build of libpq would use the
       principal name from any available Kerberos ticket as default
       database username, even if the connection wasn't using Kerberos
       authentication. This was deemed inconsistent and confusing. The
       default username is now determined the same way with or without
       Kerberos. Note however that the database username must still match
       the ticket when Kerberos authentication is used.
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) support

     * Fix certificate validation for SSL connections (Magnus)
       libpq now supports verifying both the certificate and the name of
       the server when making SSL connections. If a root certificate is
       not available to use for verification, SSL connections will fail.
       The sslmode parameter is used to enable certificate verification
       and set the level of checking. The default is still not to do any
       verification, allowing connections to SSL-enabled servers without
       requiring a root certificate on the client.
     * Support wildcard server certificates (Magnus)
       If a certificate CN starts with *, it will be treated as a wildcard
       when matching the hostname, allowing the use of the same
       certificate for multiple servers.
     * Allow the file locations for client certificates to be specified
       (Mark Woodward, Alvaro, Magnus)
     * Add a PQinitOpenSSL function to allow greater control over
       OpenSSL/libcrypto initialization (Andrew Chernow)
     * Make libpq unregister its OpenSSL callbacks when no database
       connections remain open (Bruce, Magnus, Russell Smith)
       This is required for applications that unload the libpq library,
       otherwise invalid OpenSSL callbacks will remain.
     __________________________________________________________________

ecpg

     * Add localization support for messages (Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     * ecpg parser is now automatically generated from the server parser
       (Michael)
       Previously the ecpg parser was hand-maintained.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Programming Interface (SPI)

     * Add support for single-use plans with out-of-line parameters (Tom)
     * Add new SPI_OK_REWRITTEN return code for SPI_execute() (Heikki)
       This is used when a command is rewritten to another type of
       command.
     * Remove unnecessary inclusions from "executor/spi.h" (Tom)
       SPI-using modules might need to add some #include lines if they
       were depending on "spi.h" to include things for them.
     __________________________________________________________________

Build Options

     * Update build system to use Autoconf 2.61 (Peter)
     * Require GNU bison for source code builds (Peter)
       This has effectively been required for several years, but now there
       is no infrastructure claiming to support other parser tools.
     * Add pg_config --htmldir option (Peter)
     * Pass float4 by value inside the server (Zoltan Boszormenyi)
       Add configure option --disable-float4-byval to use the old
       behavior. External C functions that use old-style (version 0) call
       convention and pass or return float4 values will be broken by this
       change, so you may need the configure option if you have such
       functions and don't want to update them.
     * Pass float8, int8, and related datatypes by value inside the server
       on 64-bit platforms (Zoltan Boszormenyi)
       Add configure option --disable-float8-byval to use the old
       behavior. As above, this change might break old-style external C
       functions.
     * Add configure options --with-segsize, --with-blocksize,
       --with-wal-blocksize, --with-wal-segsize (Zdenek Kotala, Tom)
       This simplifies build-time control over several constants that
       previously could only be changed by editing "pg_config_manual.h".
     * Allow threaded builds on Solaris 2.5 (Bruce)
     * Use the system's getopt_long() on Solaris (Zdenek Kotala, Tom)
       This makes option processing more consistent with what Solaris
       users expect.
     * Add support for the Sun Studio compiler on Linux (Julius Stroffek)
     * Append the major version number to the backend gettext domain, and
       the soname major version number to libraries' gettext domain
       (Peter)
       This simplifies parallel installations of multiple versions.
     * Add support for code coverage testing with gcov (Michelle Caisse)
     * Allow out-of-tree builds on Mingw and Cygwin (Richard Evans)
     * Fix the use of Mingw as a cross-compiling source platform (Peter)
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code

     * Support 64-bit time zone data files (Heikki)
       This adds support for daylight saving time (DST) calculations
       beyond the year 2038.
     * Deprecate use of platform's time_t data type (Tom)
       Some platforms have migrated to 64-bit time_t, some have not, and
       Windows can't make up its mind what it's doing. Define pg_time_t to
       have the same meaning as time_t, but always be 64 bits (unless the
       platform has no 64-bit integer type), and use that type in all
       module APIs and on-disk data formats.
     * Fix bug in handling of the time zone database when cross-compiling
       (Richard Evans)
     * Link backend object files in one step, rather than in stages
       (Peter)
     * Improve gettext support to allow better translation of plurals
       (Peter)
     * Add message translation support to the PL languages (Alvaro, Peter)
     * Add more DTrace probes (Robert Lor)
     * Enable DTrace support on Mac OS X Leopard and other non-Solaris
       platforms (Robert Lor)
     * Simplify and standardize conversions between C strings and text
       datums, by providing common functions for the purpose (Brendan
       Jurd, Tom)
     * Clean up the "include/catalog/" header files so that frontend
       programs can include them without including "postgres.h" (Zdenek
       Kotala)
     * Make name char-aligned, and suppress zero-padding of name entries
       in indexes (Tom)
     * Recover better if dynamically-loaded code executes exit() (Tom)
     * Add a hook to let plug-ins monitor the executor (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Add a hook to allow the planner's statistics lookup behavior to be
       overridden (Simon Riggs)
     * Add shmem_startup_hook() for custom shared memory requirements
       (Tom)
     * Replace the index access method amgetmulti entry point with
       amgetbitmap, and extend the API for amgettuple to support run-time
       determination of operator lossiness (Heikki, Tom, Teodor)
       The API for GIN and GiST opclass consistent functions has been
       extended as well.
     * Add support for partial-match searches in GIN indexes (Teodor
       Sigaev, Oleg Bartunov)
     * Replace pg_class column reltriggers with boolean relhastriggers
       (Simon)
       Also remove unused pg_class columns relukeys, relfkeys, and
       relrefs.
     * Add a relistemp column to pg_class to ease identification of
       temporary tables (Tom)
     * Move platform FAQs into the main documentation (Peter)
     * Prevent parser input files from being built with any conflicts
       (Peter)
     * Add support for the KOI8U (Ukrainian) encoding (Peter)
     * Add Japanese message translations (Japan PostgreSQL Users Group)
       This used to be maintained as a separate project.
     * Fix problem when setting LC_MESSAGES on MSVC-built systems (Hiroshi
       Inoue, Hiroshi Saito, Magnus)
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib

     * Add "contrib/auto_explain" to automatically run "EXPLAIN" on
       queries exceeding a specified duration (Itagaki Takahiro, Tom)
     * Add "contrib/btree_gin" to allow GIN indexes to handle more
       datatypes (Oleg, Teodor)
     * Add "contrib/citext" to provide a case-insensitive, multibyte-aware
       text data type (David Wheeler)
     * Add "contrib/pg_stat_statements" for server-wide tracking of
       statement execution statistics (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Add duration and query mode options to "contrib/pgbench" (Itagaki
       Takahiro)
     * Make "contrib/pgbench" use table names pgbench_accounts,
       pgbench_branches, pgbench_history, and pgbench_tellers, rather than
       just accounts, branches, history, and tellers (Tom)
       This is to reduce the risk of accidentally destroying real data by
       running pgbench.
     * Fix "contrib/pgstattuple" to handle tables and indexes with over 2
       billion pages (Tatsuhito Kasahara)
     * In "contrib/fuzzystrmatch", add a version of the Levenshtein
       string-distance function that allows the user to specify the costs
       of insertion, deletion, and substitution (Volkan Yazici)
     * Make "contrib/ltree" support multibyte encodings (laser)
     * Enable "contrib/dblink" to use connection information stored in the
       SQL/MED catalogs (Joe Conway)
     * Improve "contrib/dblink"'s reporting of errors from the remote
       server (Joe Conway)
     * Make "contrib/dblink" set client_encoding to match the local
       database's encoding (Joe Conway)
       This prevents encoding problems when communicating with a remote
       database that uses a different encoding.
     * Make sure "contrib/dblink" uses a password supplied by the user,
       and not accidentally taken from the server's ".pgpass" file (Joe
       Conway)
       This is a minor security enhancement.
     * Add fsm_page_contents() to "contrib/pageinspect" (Heikki)
     * Modify get_raw_page() to support free space map ("*_fsm") files.
       Also update "contrib/pg_freespacemap".
     * Add support for multibyte encodings to "contrib/pg_trgm" (Teodor)
     * Rewrite "contrib/intagg" to use new functions array_agg() and
       unnest() (Tom)
     * Make "contrib/pg_standby" recover all available WAL before failover
       (Fujii Masao, Simon, Heikki)
       To make this work safely, you now need to set the new
       recovery_end_command option in "recovery.conf" to clean up the
       trigger file after failover. pg_standby will no longer remove the
       trigger file itself.
     * "contrib/pg_standby"'s "-l" option is now a no-op, because it is
       unsafe to use a symlink (Simon)

                                Release 8.3.9

     Release date: 2009-12-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.8. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.9

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.8, see the release notes
   for 8.3.8.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
       changing session-local state (Gurjeet Singh, Tom)
       This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions from
       possibly subverting a superuser's session (CVE-2009-4136).
     * Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
       common name (CN) field (Magnus)
       This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a server or
       client name during SSL validation (CVE-2009-4034).
     * Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization
       (Tom)
     * Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary (Tom)
     * Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)
       This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's
       already committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
       if a plain VACUUM is interrupted after having truncated the table.
     * Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
       calculation (Tom)
       This could occur with extremely large planner estimates for the
       size of a hashjoin's result.
     * Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons (Chris Mikkelson)
     * Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared transactions
       are not ignored (Heikki)
     * Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
       accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
     * Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a new CSV
       logfile (Tom)
     * Fix Windows permission-downgrade logic (Jesse Morris)
       This fixes some cases where the database failed to start on
       Windows, often with misleading error messages such as "could not
       locate matching postgres executable".
     * Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the split
       depends on a non-first column of the index (Paul Ramsey)
     * Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file fails at
       the end of checkpoint (Heikki)
       It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and allow the
       checkpoint to complete. Future checkpoints will retry the removal.
       Such problems are not expected in normal operation, but have been
       seen to be caused by misdesigned Windows anti-virus and backup
       software.
     * Ensure WAL files aren't repeatedly archived on Windows (Heikki)
       This is another symptom that could happen if some other process
       interfered with deletion of a no-longer-needed file.
     * Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)
       The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
       Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
       domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
       was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
       stack would pass to it.
     * Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket) size in
       GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods (Ian Turner)
       While the old 2000-byte limit was more than enough for Unix
       Kerberos implementations, tickets issued by Windows Domain
       Controllers can be much larger.
     * Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences (Akira
       Kurosawa)
       This used to work but was broken in 8.3.
     * Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
       FUNCTION (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect handling of WHERE "x"="x" conditions (Tom)
       In some cases these could get ignored as redundant, but they aren't
       -- they're equivalent to "x" IS NOT NULL.
     * Make text search parser accept underscores in XML attributes
       (Peter)
     * Fix encoding handling in xml binary input (Heikki)
       If the XML header doesn't specify an encoding, we now assume UTF-8
       by default; the previous handling was inconsistent.
     * Fix bug with calling plperl from plperlu or vice versa (Tom)
       An error exit from the inner function could result in crashes due
       to failure to re-select the correct Perl interpreter for the outer
       function.
     * Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function is
       redefined (Tom)
     * Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL arrays
       when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function (Andrew Dunstan,
       Abhijit Menon-Sen)
       This worked correctly already for non-set-returning functions.
     * Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python (Peter)
     * In "contrib/pg_standby", disable triggering failover with a signal
       on Windows (Fujii Masao)
       This never did anything useful, because Windows doesn't have
       Unix-style signals, but recent changes made it actually crash.
     * Ensure psql's flex module is compiled with the correct system
       header definitions (Tom)
       This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile
       causes incompatible changes in the generated code.
     * Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
       connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
       libpq versions (Tom)
     * Update the timezone abbreviation files to match current reality
       (Joachim Wieland)
       This includes adding IDT and SGT to the default timezone
       abbreviation set.
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
       changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji, Novokuznetsk,
       Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also historical corrections for
       Hong Kong.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.3.8

     Release date: 2009-09-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.7. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   have any hash indexes on interval columns, you must "REINDEX" them
   after updating to 8.3.8. Also, if you are upgrading from a version
   earlier than 8.3.5, see the release notes for 8.3.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix Windows shared-memory allocation code (Tsutomu Yamada, Magnus)
       This bug led to the often-reported "could not reattach to shared
       memory" error message.
     * Force WAL segment switch during pg_start_backup() (Heikki)
       This avoids corner cases that could render a base backup unusable.
     * Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)
       This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch that
       disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions. (See CVE-2007-6600)
     * Make "LOAD" of an already-loaded loadable module into a no-op (Tom)
       Formerly, "LOAD" would attempt to unload and re-load the module,
       but this is unsafe and not all that useful.
     * Disallow empty passwords during LDAP authentication (Magnus)
     * Fix handling of sub-SELECTs appearing in the arguments of an
       outer-level aggregate function (Tom)
     * Fix bugs associated with fetching a whole-row value from the output
       of a Sort or Materialize plan node (Tom)
     * Prevent synchronize_seqscans from changing the results of
       scrollable and WITH HOLD cursors (Tom)
     * Revert planner change that disabled partial-index and constraint
       exclusion optimizations when there were more than 100 clauses in an
       AND or OR list (Tom)
     * Fix hash calculation for data type interval (Tom)
       This corrects wrong results for hash joins on interval values. It
       also changes the contents of hash indexes on interval columns. If
       you have any such indexes, you must "REINDEX" them after updating.
     * Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
       'HH'/'HH12' (Heikki)
       It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
     * Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
       and integer datetimes are in use (Alex Hunsaker)
     * Fix calculation of distance between a point and a line segment
       (Tom)
       This led to incorrect results from a number of geometric operators.
     * Fix money data type to work in locales where currency amounts have
       no fractional digits, e.g. Japan (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Fix LIKE for case where pattern contains %_ (Tom)
     * Properly round datetime input like
       00:12:57.9999999999999999999999999999 (Tom)
     * Fix memory leaks in XML operations (Tom)
     * Fix poor choice of page split point in GiST R-tree operator classes
       (Teodor)
     * Ensure that a "fast shutdown" request will forcibly terminate open
       sessions, even if a "smart shutdown" was already in progress (Fujii
       Masao)
     * Avoid performance degradation in bulk inserts into GIN indexes when
       the input values are (nearly) in sorted order (Tom)
     * Correctly enforce NOT NULL domain constraints in some contexts in
       PL/pgSQL (Tom)
     * Fix portability issues in plperl initialization (Andrew Dunstan)
     * Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
       empty (Jeff Davis)
     * Improve pg_dump's efficiency when there are many large objects
       (Tamas Vincze)
     * Use SIGUSR1, not SIGQUIT, as the failover signal for pg_standby
       (Heikki)
     * Make pg_standby's maxretries option behave as documented (Fujii
       Masao)
     * Make "contrib/hstore" throw an error when a key or value is too
       long to fit in its data structure, rather than silently truncating
       it (Andrew Gierth)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
       number of parameters (twenty) (Tom)
     * Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
       "COPY FROM STDIN" (Tom)
     * Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
       both libraries are installed (Zdenek Kotala)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009l for DST law
       changes in Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Argentina/San_Luis,
       Cuba, Jordan (historical correction only), Mauritius, Morocco,
       Palestine, Syria, Tunisia.

                                Release 8.3.7

     Release date: 2009-03-16

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.6. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.5, see the release notes
   for 8.3.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails
       (Tom)
       This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
       related failure scenarios. The previous fixes were narrowly
       tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now
       recognized that *any* error thrown by an encoding conversion
       function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying
       to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable
       translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form
       of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive
       error reporting situation. (CVE-2009-0922)
     * Disallow "CREATE CONVERSION" with the wrong encodings for the
       specified conversion function (Heikki)
       This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion
       failure. The previous change is a backstop to guard against other
       kinds of failures in the same area.
     * Fix xpath() to not modify the path expression unless necessary, and
       to make a saner attempt at it when necessary (Andrew)
       The SQL standard suggests that xpath should work on data that is a
       document fragment, but libxml doesn't support that, and indeed it's
       not clear that this is sensible according to the XPath standard.
       xpath attempted to work around this mismatch by modifying both the
       data and the path expression, but the modification was buggy and
       could cause valid searches to fail. Now, xpath checks whether the
       data is in fact a well-formed document, and if so invokes libxml
       with no change to the data or path expression. Otherwise, a
       different modification method that is somewhat less likely to fail
       is used.

     Note: The new modification method is still not 100% satisfactory,
     and it seems likely that no real solution is possible. This patch
     should therefore be viewed as a band-aid to keep from breaking
     existing applications unnecessarily. It is likely that PostgreSQL
     8.4 will simply reject use of xpath on data that is not a
     well-formed document.
     * Fix core dump when to_char() is given format codes that are
       inappropriate for the type of the data argument (Tom)
     * Fix possible failure in text search when C locale is used with a
       multi-byte encoding (Teodor)
       Crashes were possible on platforms where wchar_t is narrower than
       int; Windows in particular.
     * Fix extreme inefficiency in text search parser's handling of an
       email-like string containing multiple @ characters (Heikki)
     * Fix planner problem with sub-"SELECT" in the output list of a
       larger subquery (Tom)
       The known symptom of this bug is a "failed to locate grouping
       columns" error that is dependent on the datatype involved; but
       there could be other issues as well.
     * Fix decompilation of CASE WHEN with an implicit coercion (Tom)
       This mistake could lead to Assert failures in an Assert-enabled
       build, or an "unexpected CASE WHEN clause" error message in other
       cases, when trying to examine or dump a view.
     * Fix possible misassignment of the owner of a TOAST table's rowtype
       (Tom)
       If "CLUSTER" or a rewriting variant of "ALTER TABLE" were executed
       by someone other than the table owner, the pg_type entry for the
       table's TOAST table would end up marked as owned by that someone.
       This caused no immediate problems, since the permissions on the
       TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any ordinary database operation.
       However, it could lead to unexpected failures if one later tried to
       drop the role that issued the command (in 8.1 or 8.2), or "owner of
       data type appears to be invalid" warnings from pg_dump after having
       done so (in 8.3).
     * Change "UNLISTEN" to exit quickly if the current session has never
       executed any "LISTEN" command (Tom)
       Most of the time this is not a particularly useful optimization,
       but since "DISCARD ALL" invokes "UNLISTEN", the previous coding
       caused a substantial performance problem for applications that made
       heavy use of "DISCARD ALL".
     * Fix PL/pgSQL to not treat INTO after "INSERT" as an INTO-variables
       clause anywhere in the string, not only at the start; in
       particular, don't fail for "INSERT INTO" within "CREATE RULE" (Tom)
     * Clean up PL/pgSQL error status variables fully at block exit
       (Ashesh Vashi and Dave Page)
       This is not a problem for PL/pgSQL itself, but the omission could
       cause the PL/pgSQL Debugger to crash while examining the state of a
       function.
     * Retry failed calls to CallNamedPipe() on Windows (Steve Marshall,
       Magnus)
       It appears that this function can sometimes fail transiently; we
       previously treated any failure as a hard error, which could confuse
       "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" as well as other operations.
     * Add MUST (Mauritius Island Summer Time) to the default list of
       known timezone abbreviations (Xavier Bugaud)

                                Release 8.3.6

     Release date: 2009-02-02

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.5. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.5, see the release notes
   for 8.3.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Make "DISCARD ALL" release advisory locks, in addition to
       everything it already did (Tom)
       This was decided to be the most appropriate behavior. This could
       affect existing applications, however.
     * Fix whole-index GiST scans to work correctly (Teodor)
       This error could cause rows to be lost if a table is clustered on a
       GiST index.
     * Fix crash of xmlconcat(NULL) (Peter)
     * Fix possible crash in ispell dictionary if high-bit-set characters
       are used as flags (Teodor)
       This is known to be done by one widely available Norwegian
       dictionary, and the same condition may exist in others.
     * Fix misordering of pg_dump output for composite types (Tom)
       The most likely problem was for user-defined operator classes to be
       dumped after indexes or views that needed them.
     * Improve handling of URLs in headline() function (Teodor)
     * Improve handling of overlength headlines in headline() function
       (Teodor)
     * Prevent possible Assert failure or misconversion if an encoding
       conversion is created with the wrong conversion function for the
       specified pair of encodings (Tom, Heikki)
     * Fix possible Assert failure if a statement executed in PL/pgSQL is
       rewritten into another kind of statement, for example if an
       "INSERT" is rewritten into an "UPDATE" (Heikki)
     * Ensure that a snapshot is available to datatype input functions
       (Tom)
       This primarily affects domains that are declared with CHECK
       constraints involving user-defined stable or immutable functions.
       Such functions typically fail if no snapshot has been set.
     * Make it safer for SPI-using functions to be used within datatype
       I/O; in particular, to be used in domain check constraints (Tom)
     * Avoid unnecessary locking of small tables in "VACUUM" (Heikki)
     * Fix a problem that sometimes kept "ALTER TABLE ENABLE/DISABLE RULE"
       from being recognized by active sessions (Tom)
     * Fix a problem that made UPDATE RETURNING tableoid return zero
       instead of the correct OID (Tom)
     * Allow functions declared as taking ANYARRAY to work on the
       pg_statistic columns of that type (Tom)
       This used to work, but was unintentionally broken in 8.3.
     * Fix planner misestimation of selectivity when transitive equality
       is applied to an outer-join clause (Tom)
       This could result in bad plans for queries like ... from a left
       join b on a.a1 = b.b1 where a.a1 = 42 ...
     * Improve optimizer's handling of long IN lists (Tom)
       This change avoids wasting large amounts of time on such lists when
       constraint exclusion is enabled.
     * Prevent synchronous scan during GIN index build (Tom)
       Because GIN is optimized for inserting tuples in increasing TID
       order, choosing to use a synchronous scan could slow the build by a
       factor of three or more.
     * Ensure that the contents of a holdable cursor don't depend on the
       contents of TOAST tables (Tom)
       Previously, large field values in a cursor result might be
       represented as TOAST pointers, which would fail if the referenced
       table got dropped before the cursor is read, or if the large value
       is deleted and then vacuumed away. This cannot happen with an
       ordinary cursor, but it could with a cursor that is held past its
       creating transaction.
     * Fix memory leak when a set-returning function is terminated without
       reading its whole result (Tom)
     * Fix encoding conversion problems in XML functions when the database
       encoding isn't UTF-8 (Tom)
     * Fix "contrib/dblink"'s dblink_get_result(text,bool) function (Joe)
     * Fix possible garbage output from "contrib/sslinfo" functions (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect behavior of "contrib/tsearch2" compatibility trigger
       when it's fired more than once in a command (Teodor)
     * Fix possible mis-signaling in autovacuum (Heikki)
     * Support running as a service on Windows 7 beta (Dave and Magnus)
     * Fix ecpg's handling of varchar structs (Michael)
     * Fix configure script to properly report failure when unable to
       obtain linkage information for PL/Perl (Andrew)
     * Make all documentation reference pgsql-bugs and/or pgsql-hackers as
       appropriate, instead of the now-decommissioned pgsql-ports and
       pgsql-patches mailing lists (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009a (for Kathmandu
       and historical DST corrections in Switzerland, Cuba)

                                Release 8.3.5

     Release date: 2008-11-03

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.4. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.1, see the release notes
   for 8.3.1. Also, if you were running a previous 8.3.X release, it is
   recommended to "REINDEX" all GiST indexes after the upgrade.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix GiST index corruption due to marking the wrong index entry
       "dead" after a deletion (Teodor)
       This would result in index searches failing to find rows they
       should have found. Corrupted indexes can be fixed with "REINDEX".
     * Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a
       localized error message (Tom)
       We have addressed similar issues before, but it would still fail if
       the "character has no equivalent" message itself couldn't be
       converted. The fix is to disable localization and send the plain
       ASCII error message when we detect such a situation.
     * Fix possible crash in bytea-to-XML mapping (Michael McMaster)
     * Fix possible crash when deeply nested functions are invoked from a
       trigger (Tom)
     * Improve optimization of "expression" IN ("expression-list") queries
       (Tom, per an idea from Robert Haas)
       Cases in which there are query variables on the right-hand side had
       been handled less efficiently in 8.2.x and 8.3.x than in prior
       versions. The fix restores 8.1 behavior for such cases.
     * Fix mis-expansion of rule queries when a sub-SELECT appears in a
       function call in FROM, a multi-row VALUES list, or a RETURNING list
       (Tom)
       The usual symptom of this problem is an "unrecognized node type"
       error.
     * Fix Assert failure during rescan of an IS NULL search of a GiST
       index (Teodor)
     * Fix memory leak during rescan of a hashed aggregation plan (Neil)
     * Ensure an error is reported when a newly-defined PL/pgSQL trigger
       function is invoked as a normal function (Tom)
     * Force a checkpoint before "CREATE DATABASE" starts to copy files
       (Heikki)
       This prevents a possible failure if files had recently been deleted
       in the source database.
     * Prevent possible collision of relfilenode numbers when moving a
       table to another tablespace with "ALTER SET TABLESPACE" (Heikki)
       The command tried to re-use the existing filename, instead of
       picking one that is known unused in the destination directory.
     * Fix incorrect text search headline generation when single query
       item matches first word of text (Sushant Sinha)
     * Fix improper display of fractional seconds in interval values when
       using a non-ISO datestyle in an "--enable-integer-datetimes" build
       (Ron Mayer)
     * Make ILIKE compare characters case-insensitively even when they're
       escaped (Andrew)
     * Ensure "DISCARD" is handled properly by statement logging (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect logging of last-completed-transaction time during
       PITR recovery (Tom)
     * Ensure SPI_getvalue and SPI_getbinval behave correctly when the
       passed tuple and tuple descriptor have different numbers of columns
       (Tom)
       This situation is normal when a table has had columns added or
       removed, but these two functions didn't handle it properly. The
       only likely consequence is an incorrect error indication.
     * Mark SessionReplicationRole as PGDLLIMPORT so it can be used by
       Slony on Windows (Magnus)
     * Fix small memory leak when using libpq's gsslib parameter (Magnus)
       The space used by the parameter string was not freed at connection
       close.
     * Ensure libgssapi is linked into libpq if needed (Markus Schaaf)
     * Fix ecpg's parsing of "CREATE ROLE" (Michael)
     * Fix recent breakage of pg_ctl restart (Tom)
     * Ensure "pg_control" is opened in binary mode (Itagaki Takahiro)
       pg_controldata and pg_resetxlog did this incorrectly, and so could
       fail on Windows.
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008i (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Brazil, Mauritius, Syria)

                                Release 8.3.4

     Release date: 2008-09-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.3. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.1, see the release notes
   for 8.3.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix bug in btree WAL recovery code (Heikki)
       Recovery failed if the WAL ended partway through a page split
       operation.
     * Fix potential use of wrong cutoff XID for HOT page pruning (Alvaro)
       This error created a risk of corruption in system catalogs that are
       consulted by "VACUUM": dead tuple versions might be removed too
       soon. The impact of this on actual database operations would be
       minimal, since the system doesn't follow MVCC rules while examining
       catalogs, but it might result in transiently wrong output from
       pg_dump or other client programs.
     * Fix potential miscalculation of datfrozenxid (Alvaro)
       This error may explain some recent reports of failure to remove old
       pg_clog data.
     * Fix incorrect HOT updates after pg_class is reindexed (Tom)
       Corruption of pg_class could occur if REINDEX TABLE pg_class was
       followed in the same session by an ALTER TABLE RENAME or ALTER
       TABLE SET SCHEMA command.
     * Fix missed "combo cid" case (Karl Schnaitter)
       This error made rows incorrectly invisible to a transaction in
       which they had been deleted by multiple subtransactions that all
       aborted.
     * Prevent autovacuum from crashing if the table it's currently
       checking is deleted at just the wrong time (Alvaro)
     * Widen local lock counters from 32 to 64 bits (Tom)
       This responds to reports that the counters could overflow in
       sufficiently long transactions, leading to unexpected "lock is
       already held" errors.
     * Fix possible duplicate output of tuples during a GiST index scan
       (Teodor)
     * Regenerate foreign key checking queries from scratch when either
       table is modified (Tom)
       Previously, 8.3 would attempt to replan the query, but would work
       from previously generated query text. This led to failures if a
       table or column was renamed.
     * Fix missed permissions checks when a view contains a simple UNION
       ALL construct (Heikki)
       Permissions for the referenced tables were checked properly, but
       not permissions for the view itself.
     * Add checks in executor startup to ensure that the tuples produced
       by an "INSERT" or "UPDATE" will match the target table's current
       rowtype (Tom)
       This situation is believed to be impossible in 8.3, but it can
       happen in prior releases, so a check seems prudent.
     * Fix possible repeated drops during "DROP OWNED" (Tom)
       This would typically result in strange errors such as "cache lookup
       failed for relation NNN".
     * Fix several memory leaks in XML operations (Kris Jurka, Tom)
     * Fix xmlserialize() to raise error properly for unacceptable target
       data type (Tom)
     * Fix a couple of places that mis-handled multibyte characters in
       text search configuration file parsing (Tom)
       Certain characters occurring in configuration files would always
       cause "invalid byte sequence for encoding" failures.
     * Provide file name and line number location for all errors reported
       in text search configuration files (Tom)
     * Fix AT TIME ZONE to first try to interpret its timezone argument as
       a timezone abbreviation, and only try it as a full timezone name if
       that fails, rather than the other way around as formerly (Tom)
       The timestamp input functions have always resolved ambiguous zone
       names in this order. Making AT TIME ZONE do so as well improves
       consistency, and fixes a compatibility bug introduced in 8.1: in
       ambiguous cases we now behave the same as 8.0 and before did, since
       in the older versions AT TIME ZONE accepted *only* abbreviations.
     * Fix datetime input functions to correctly detect integer overflow
       when running on a 64-bit platform (Tom)
     * Prevent integer overflows during units conversion when displaying a
       configuration parameter that has units (Tom)
     * Improve performance of writing very long log messages to syslog
       (Tom)
     * Allow spaces in the suffix part of an LDAP URL in "pg_hba.conf"
       (Tom)
     * Fix bug in backwards scanning of a cursor on a SELECT DISTINCT ON
       query (Tom)
     * Fix planner bug that could improperly push down IS NULL tests below
       an outer join (Tom)
       This was triggered by occurrence of IS NULL tests for the same
       relation in all arms of an upper OR clause.
     * Fix planner bug with nested sub-select expressions (Tom)
       If the outer sub-select has no direct dependency on the parent
       query, but the inner one does, the outer value might not get
       recalculated for new parent query rows.
     * Fix planner to estimate that GROUP BY expressions yielding boolean
       results always result in two groups, regardless of the expressions'
       contents (Tom)
       This is very substantially more accurate than the regular GROUP BY
       estimate for certain boolean tests like "col" IS NULL.
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to not fail when a FOR loop's target variable is a
       record containing composite-type fields (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Tcl to behave correctly with Tcl 8.5, and to be more careful
       about the encoding of data sent to or from Tcl (Tom)
     * Improve performance of PQescapeBytea() (Rudolf Leitgeb)
     * On Windows, work around a Microsoft bug by preventing libpq from
       trying to send more than 64kB per system call (Magnus)
     * Fix ecpg to handle variables properly in "SET" commands (Michael)
     * Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's error reporting after failure to
       send a SQL command (Tom)
     * Fix pg_ctl to properly preserve postmaster command-line arguments
       across a restart (Bruce)
     * Fix erroneous WAL file cutoff point calculation in pg_standby
       (Simon)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008f (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Mauritius, Morocco,
       Pakistan, Palestine, and Paraguay)

                                Release 8.3.3

     Release date: 2008-06-12

   This release contains one serious and one minor bug fix over 8.3.2. For
   information about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the
   Section called Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.3

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.1, see the release notes
   for 8.3.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Make pg_get_ruledef() parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
       Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be
       dumped as, say, -42::integer, which is subtly incorrect: it should
       be (-42)::integer due to operator precedence rules. Usually this
       would make little difference, but it could interact with another
       recent patch to cause PostgreSQL to reject what had been a valid
       "SELECT DISTINCT" view query. Since this could result in pg_dump
       output failing to reload, it is being treated as a high-priority
       fix. The only released versions in which dump output is actually
       incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.
     * Make "ALTER AGGREGATE ... OWNER TO" update pg_shdepend (Tom)
       This oversight could lead to problems if the aggregate was later
       involved in a "DROP OWNED" or "REASSIGN OWNED" operation.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.3.2

     Release date: never released

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.1. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.1, see the release notes
   for 8.3.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix ERRORDATA_STACK_SIZE exceeded crash that occurred on Windows
       when using UTF-8 database encoding and a different client encoding
       (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect archive truncation point calculation for the %r macro
       in recovery_command parameters (Simon)
       This could lead to data loss if a warm-standby script relied on %r
       to decide when to throw away WAL segment files.
     * Fix "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ... PRIMARY KEY" so that the new column
       is correctly checked to see if it's been initialized to all
       non-nulls (Brendan Jurd)
       Previous versions neglected to check this requirement at all.
     * Fix "REASSIGN OWNED" so that it works on procedural languages too
       (Alvaro)
     * Fix problems with "SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE" occurring as a subquery
       in a query with a non-"SELECT" top-level operation (Tom)
     * Fix possible "CREATE TABLE" failure when inheriting the "same"
       constraint from multiple parent relations that inherited that
       constraint from a common ancestor (Tom)
     * Fix pg_get_ruledef() to show the alias, if any, attached to the
       target table of an "UPDATE" or "DELETE" (Tom)
     * Restore the pre-8.3 behavior that an out-of-range block number in a
       TID being used in a TidScan plan results in silently not matching
       any rows (Tom)
       8.3.0 and 8.3.1 threw an error instead.
     * Fix GIN bug that could result in a too many LWLocks taken failure
       (Teodor)
     * Fix broken GiST comparison function for tsquery (Teodor)
     * Fix tsvector_update_trigger() and ts_stat() to accept domains over
       the types they expect to work with (Tom)
     * Fix failure to support enum data types as foreign keys (Tom)
     * Avoid possible crash when decompressing corrupted data (Zdenek
       Kotala)
     * Fix race conditions between delayed unlinks and "DROP DATABASE"
       (Heikki)
       In the worst case this could result in deleting a newly created
       table in a new database that happened to get the same OID as the
       recently-dropped one; but of course that is an extremely
       low-probability scenario.
     * Repair two places where SIGTERM exit of a backend could leave
       corrupted state in shared memory (Tom)
       Neither case is very important if SIGTERM is used to shut down the
       whole database cluster together, but there was a problem if someone
       tried to SIGTERM individual backends.
     * Fix possible crash due to incorrect plan generated for an x IN
       (SELECT y FROM ...) clause when "x" and "y" have different data
       types; and make sure the behavior is semantically correct when the
       conversion from "y"'s type to "x"'s type is lossy (Tom)
     * Fix oversight that prevented the planner from substituting known
       Param values as if they were constants (Tom)
       This mistake partially disabled optimization of unnamed
       extended-Query statements in 8.3.0 and 8.3.1: in particular the
       LIKE-to-indexscan optimization would never be applied if the LIKE
       pattern was passed as a parameter, and constraint exclusion
       depending on a parameter value didn't work either.
     * Fix planner failure when an indexable MIN or MAX aggregate is used
       with DISTINCT or ORDER BY (Tom)
     * Fix planner to ensure it never uses a "physical tlist" for a plan
       node that is feeding a Sort node (Tom)
       This led to the sort having to push around more data than it really
       needed to, since unused column values were included in the sorted
       data.
     * Avoid unnecessary copying of query strings (Tom)
       This fixes a performance problem introduced in 8.3.0 when a very
       large number of commands are submitted as a single query string.
     * Make TransactionIdIsCurrentTransactionId() use binary search
       instead of linear search when checking child-transaction XIDs
       (Heikki)
       This fixes some cases in which 8.3.0 was significantly slower than
       earlier releases.
     * Fix conversions between ISO-8859-5 and other encodings to handle
       Cyrillic "Yo" characters (e and E with two dots) (Sergey Burladyan)
     * Fix several datatype input functions, notably array_in(), that were
       allowing unused bytes in their results to contain uninitialized,
       unpredictable values (Tom)
       This could lead to failures in which two apparently identical
       literal values were not seen as equal, resulting in the parser
       complaining about unmatched ORDER BY and DISTINCT expressions.
     * Fix a corner case in regular-expression substring matching
       (substring(string from pattern)) (Tom)
       The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
       the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
       subexpression hasn't got a match. An example is substring('foo'
       from 'foo(bar)?'). This should return NULL, since (bar) isn't
       matched, but it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match
       instead (ie, foo).
     * Prevent cancellation of an auto-vacuum that was launched to prevent
       XID wraparound (Alvaro)
     * Improve "ANALYZE"'s handling of in-doubt tuples (those inserted or
       deleted by a not-yet-committed transaction) so that the counts it
       reports to the stats collector are more likely to be correct (Pavan
       Deolasee)
     * Fix initdb to reject a relative path for its --xlogdir (-X) option
       (Tom)
     * Make psql print tab characters as an appropriate number of spaces,
       rather than \x09 as was done in 8.3.0 and 8.3.1 (Bruce)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008c (for DST law
       changes in Morocco, Iraq, Choibalsan, Pakistan, Syria, Cuba, and
       Argentina/San_Luis)
     * Add ECPGget_PGconn() function to ecpglib (Michael)
     * Fix incorrect result from ecpg's PGTYPEStimestamp_sub() function
       (Michael)
     * Fix handling of continuation line markers in ecpg (Michael)
     * Fix possible crashes in "contrib/cube" functions (Tom)
     * Fix core dump in "contrib/xml2"'s xpath_table() function when the
       input query returns a NULL value (Tom)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s makefile to not override CFLAGS, and make it
       auto-configure properly for libxslt present or not (Tom)

                                Release 8.3.1

     Release date: 2008-03-17

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.0. For information
   about new features in the 8.3 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3.1

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X. However, you
   might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns after updating, if
   you are affected by the Windows locale issue described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix character string comparison for Windows locales that consider
       different character combinations as equal (Tom)
       This fix applies only on Windows and only when using UTF-8 database
       encoding. The same fix was made for all other cases over two years
       ago, but Windows with UTF-8 uses a separate code path that was not
       updated. If you are using a locale that considers some
       non-identical strings as equal, you may need to "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns.
     * Repair corner-case bugs in "VACUUM FULL" (Tom)
       A potential deadlock between concurrent "VACUUM FULL" operations on
       different system catalogs was introduced in 8.2. This has now been
       corrected. 8.3 made this worse because the deadlock could occur
       within a critical code section, making it a PANIC rather than just
       ERROR condition.
       Also, a "VACUUM FULL" that failed partway through vacuuming a
       system catalog could result in cache corruption in concurrent
       database sessions.
       Another "VACUUM FULL" bug introduced in 8.3 could result in a crash
       or out-of-memory report when dealing with pages containing no live
       tuples.
     * Fix misbehavior of foreign key checks involving character or bit
       columns (Tom)
       If the referencing column were of a different but compatible type
       (for instance varchar), the constraint was enforced incorrectly.
     * Avoid needless deadlock failures in no-op foreign-key checks
       (Stephan Szabo, Tom)
     * Fix possible core dump when re-planning a prepared query (Tom)
       This bug affected only protocol-level prepare operations, not SQL
       "PREPARE", and so tended to be seen only with JDBC, DBI, and other
       client-side drivers that use prepared statements heavily.
     * Fix possible failure when re-planning a query that calls an
       SPI-using function (Tom)
     * Fix failure in row-wise comparisons involving columns of different
       datatypes (Tom)
     * Fix longstanding "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" race condition (Tom)
       In rare cases a session that had just executed a "LISTEN" might not
       get a notification, even though one would be expected because the
       concurrent transaction executing "NOTIFY" was observed to commit
       later.
       A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed a
       not-yet-committed "LISTEN" command will not see any row in
       pg_listener for the "LISTEN", should it choose to look; formerly it
       would have. This behavior was never documented one way or the
       other, but it is possible that some applications depend on the old
       behavior.
     * Disallow "LISTEN" and "UNLISTEN" within a prepared transaction
       (Tom)
       This was formerly allowed but trying to do it had various
       unpleasant consequences, notably that the originating backend could
       not exit as long as an "UNLISTEN" remained uncommitted.
     * Disallow dropping a temporary table within a prepared transaction
       (Heikki)
       This was correctly disallowed by 8.1, but the check was
       inadvertently broken in 8.2 and 8.3.
     * Fix rare crash when an error occurs during a query using a hash
       index (Heikki)
     * Fix incorrect comparison of tsquery values (Teodor)
     * Fix incorrect behavior of LIKE with non-ASCII characters in
       single-byte encodings (Rolf Jentsch)
     * Disable xmlvalidate (Tom)
       This function should have been removed before 8.3 release, but was
       inadvertently left in the source code. It poses a small security
       risk since unprivileged users could use it to read the first few
       characters of any file accessible to the server.
     * Fix memory leaks in certain usages of set-returning functions
       (Neil)
     * Make encode(bytea, 'escape') convert all high-bit-set byte values
       into \"nnn" octal escape sequences (Tom)
       This is necessary to avoid encoding problems when the database
       encoding is multi-byte. This change could pose compatibility issues
       for applications that are expecting specific results from encode.
     * Fix input of datetime values for February 29 in years BC (Tom)
       The former coding was mistaken about which years were leap years.
     * Fix "unrecognized node type" error in some variants of "ALTER
       OWNER" (Tom)
     * Avoid tablespace permissions errors in "CREATE TABLE LIKE INCLUDING
       INDEXES" (Tom)
     * Ensure pg_stat_activity.waiting flag is cleared when a lock wait is
       aborted (Tom)
     * Fix handling of process permissions on Windows Vista (Dave, Magnus)
       In particular, this fix allows starting the server as the
       Administrator user.
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008a (in particular,
       recent Chile changes); adjust timezone abbreviation VET (Venezuela)
       to mean UTC-4:30, not UTC-4:00 (Tom)
     * Fix ecpg problems with arrays (Michael)
     * Fix pg_ctl to correctly extract the postmaster's port number from
       command-line options (Itagaki Takahiro, Tom)
       Previously, pg_ctl start -w could try to contact the postmaster on
       the wrong port, leading to bogus reports of startup failure.
     * Use "-fwrapv" to defend against possible misoptimization in recent
       gcc versions (Tom)
       This is known to be necessary when building PostgreSQL with gcc 4.3
       or later.
     * Enable building "contrib/uuid-ossp" with MSVC (Hiroshi Saito)

                                 Release 8.3

     Release date: 2008-02-04
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   With significant new functionality and performance enhancements, this
   release represents a major leap forward for PostgreSQL. This was made
   possible by a growing community that has dramatically accelerated the
   pace of development. This release adds the following major features:

     * Full text search is integrated into the core database system
     * Support for the SQL/XML standard, including new operators and an
       XML data type
     * Enumerated data types (ENUM)
     * Arrays of composite types
     * Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) data type
     * Add control over whether NULLs sort first or last
     * Updatable cursors
     * Server configuration parameters can now be set on a per-function
       basis
     * User-defined types can now have type modifiers
     * Automatically re-plan cached queries when table definitions change
       or statistics are updated
     * Numerous improvements in logging and statistics collection
     * Support Security Service Provider Interface (SSPI) for
       authentication on Windows
     * Support multiple concurrent autovacuum processes, and other
       autovacuum improvements
     * Allow the whole PostgreSQL distribution to be compiled with
       Microsoft Visual C++

   Major performance improvements are listed below. Most of these
   enhancements are automatic and do not require user changes or tuning:

     * Asynchronous commit delays writes to WAL during transaction commit
     * Checkpoint writes can be spread over a longer time period to smooth
       the I/O spike during each checkpoint
     * Heap-Only Tuples (HOT) accelerate space reuse for most "UPDATE"s
       and "DELETE"s
     * Just-in-time background writer strategy improves disk write
       efficiency
     * Using non-persistent transaction IDs for read-only transactions
       reduces overhead and "VACUUM" requirements
     * Per-field and per-row storage overhead has been reduced
     * Large sequential scans no longer force out frequently used cached
       pages
     * Concurrent large sequential scans can now share disk reads
     * ORDER BY ... LIMIT can be done without sorting

   The above items are explained in more detail in the sections below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.3

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:
     __________________________________________________________________

General

     * Non-character data types are no longer automatically cast to TEXT
       (Peter, Tom)
       Previously, if a non-character value was supplied to an operator or
       function that requires text input, it was automatically cast to
       text, for most (though not all) built-in data types. This no longer
       happens: an explicit cast to text is now required for all
       non-character-string types. For example, these expressions formerly
       worked:
substr(current_date, 1, 4)
23 LIKE '2%'
       but will now draw "function does not exist" and "operator does not
       exist" errors respectively. Use an explicit cast instead:
substr(current_date::text, 1, 4)
23::text LIKE '2%'
       (Of course, you can use the more verbose CAST() syntax too.) The
       reason for the change is that these automatic casts too often
       caused surprising behavior. An example is that in previous
       releases, this expression was accepted but did not do what was
       expected:
current_date < 2017-11-17
       This is actually comparing a date to an integer, which should be
       (and now is) rejected -- but in the presence of automatic casts
       both sides were cast to text and a textual comparison was done,
       because the text < text operator was able to match the expression
       when no other < operator could.
       Types char(n) and varchar(n) still cast to text automatically.
       Also, automatic casting to text still works for inputs to the
       concatenation (||) operator, so long as least one input is a
       character-string type.
     * Full text search features from "contrib/tsearch2" have been moved
       into the core server, with some minor syntax changes
       "contrib/tsearch2" now contains a compatibility interface.
     * ARRAY(SELECT ...), where the "SELECT" returns no rows, now returns
       an empty array, rather than NULL (Tom)
     * The array type name for a base data type is no longer always the
       base type's name with an underscore prefix
       The old naming convention is still honored when possible, but
       application code should no longer depend on it. Instead use the new
       pg_type.typarray column to identify the array data type associated
       with a given type.
     * ORDER BY ... USING "operator" must now use a less-than or
       greater-than "operator" that is defined in a btree operator class
       This restriction was added to prevent inconsistent results.
     * "SET LOCAL" changes now persist until the end of the outermost
       transaction, unless rolled back (Tom)
       Previously "SET LOCAL"'s effects were lost after subtransaction
       commit ("RELEASE SAVEPOINT" or exit from a PL/pgSQL exception
       block).
     * Commands rejected in transaction blocks are now also rejected in
       multiple-statement query strings (Tom)
       For example, "BEGIN; DROP DATABASE; COMMIT" will now be rejected
       even if submitted as a single query message.
     * "ROLLBACK" outside a transaction block now issues NOTICE instead of
       WARNING (Bruce)
     * Prevent "NOTIFY"/"LISTEN"/"UNLISTEN" from accepting
       schema-qualified names (Bruce)
       Formerly, these commands accepted schema.relation but ignored the
       schema part, which was confusing.
     * "ALTER SEQUENCE" no longer affects the sequence's currval() state
       (Tom)
     * Foreign keys now must match indexable conditions for
       cross-data-type references (Tom)
       This improves semantic consistency and helps avoid performance
       problems.
     * Restrict object size functions to users who have reasonable
       permissions to view such information (Tom)
       For example, pg_database_size() now requires CONNECT permission,
       which is granted to everyone by default. pg_tablespace_size()
       requires CREATE permission in the tablespace, or is allowed if the
       tablespace is the default tablespace for the database.
     * Remove the undocumented !!= (not in) operator (Tom)
       NOT IN (SELECT ...) is the proper way to perform this operation.
     * Internal hashing functions are now more uniformly-distributed (Tom)
       If application code was computing and storing hash values using
       internal PostgreSQL hashing functions, the hash values must be
       regenerated.
     * C-code conventions for handling variable-length data values have
       changed (Greg Stark, Tom)
       The new SET_VARSIZE() macro *must* be used to set the length of
       generated varlena values. Also, it might be necessary to expand
       ("de-TOAST") input values in more cases.
     * Continuous archiving no longer reports each successful archive
       operation to the server logs unless DEBUG level is used (Simon)
     __________________________________________________________________

Configuration Parameters

     * Numerous changes in administrative server parameters
       bgwriter_lru_percent, bgwriter_all_percent, bgwriter_all_maxpages,
       stats_start_collector, and stats_reset_on_server_start are removed.
       redirect_stderr is renamed to logging_collector.
       stats_command_string is renamed to track_activities.
       stats_block_level and stats_row_level are merged into track_counts.
       A new boolean configuration parameter, archive_mode, controls
       archiving. Autovacuum's default settings have changed.
     * Remove stats_start_collector parameter (Tom)
       We now always start the collector process, unless UDP socket
       creation fails.
     * Remove stats_reset_on_server_start parameter (Tom)
       This was removed because pg_stat_reset() can be used for this
       purpose.
     * Commenting out a parameter in "postgresql.conf" now causes it to
       revert to its default value (Joachim Wieland)
       Previously, commenting out an entry left the parameter's value
       unchanged until the next server restart.
     __________________________________________________________________

Character Encodings

     * Add more checks for invalidly-encoded data (Andrew)
       This change plugs some holes that existed in literal backslash
       escape string processing and "COPY" escape processing. Now the
       de-escaped string is rechecked to see if the result created an
       invalid multi-byte character.
     * Disallow database encodings that are inconsistent with the server's
       locale setting (Tom)
       On most platforms, C locale is the only locale that will work with
       any database encoding. Other locale settings imply a specific
       encoding and will misbehave if the database encoding is something
       different. (Typical symptoms include bogus textual sort order and
       wrong results from upper() or lower().) The server now rejects
       attempts to create databases that have an incompatible encoding.
     * Ensure that chr() cannot create invalidly-encoded values (Andrew)
       In UTF8-encoded databases the argument of chr() is now treated as a
       Unicode code point. In other multi-byte encodings chr()'s argument
       must designate a 7-bit ASCII character. Zero is no longer accepted.
       ascii() has been adjusted to match.
     * Adjust convert() behavior to ensure encoding validity (Andrew)
       The two argument form of convert() has been removed. The three
       argument form now takes a bytea first argument and returns a bytea.
       To cover the loss of functionality, three new functions have been
       added:
          + convert_from(bytea, name) returns text -- converts the first
            argument from the named encoding to the database encoding
          + convert_to(text, name) returns bytea -- converts the first
            argument from the database encoding to the named encoding
          + length(bytea, name) returns integer -- gives the length of the
            first argument in characters in the named encoding
     * Remove convert(argument USING conversion_name) (Andrew)
       Its behavior did not match the SQL standard.
     * Make JOHAB encoding client-only (Tatsuo)
       JOHAB is not safe as a server-side encoding.

Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the changes between
   PostgreSQL 8.3 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance

     * Asynchronous commit delays writes to WAL during transaction commit
       (Simon)
       This feature dramatically increases performance for short
       data-modifying transactions. The disadvantage is that because disk
       writes are delayed, if the database or operating system crashes
       before data is written to the disk, committed data will be lost.
       This feature is useful for applications that can accept some data
       loss. Unlike turning off fsync, using asynchronous commit does not
       put database consistency at risk; the worst case is that after a
       crash the last few reportedly-committed transactions might not be
       committed after all. This feature is enabled by turning off
       synchronous_commit (which can be done per-session or
       per-transaction, if some transactions are critical and others are
       not). wal_writer_delay can be adjusted to control the maximum delay
       before transactions actually reach disk.
     * Checkpoint writes can be spread over a longer time period to smooth
       the I/O spike during each checkpoint (Itagaki Takahiro and Heikki
       Linnakangas)
       Previously all modified buffers were forced to disk as quickly as
       possible during a checkpoint, causing an I/O spike that decreased
       server performance. This new approach spreads out disk writes
       during checkpoints, reducing peak I/O usage. (User-requested and
       shutdown checkpoints are still written as quickly as possible.)
     * Heap-Only Tuples (HOT) accelerate space reuse for most "UPDATE"s
       and "DELETE"s (Pavan Deolasee, with ideas from many others)
       "UPDATE"s and "DELETE"s leave dead tuples behind, as do failed
       "INSERT"s. Previously only "VACUUM" could reclaim space taken by
       dead tuples. With HOT dead tuple space can be automatically
       reclaimed at the time of "INSERT" or "UPDATE" if no changes are
       made to indexed columns. This allows for more consistent
       performance. Also, HOT avoids adding duplicate index entries.
     * Just-in-time background writer strategy improves disk write
       efficiency (Greg Smith, Itagaki Takahiro)
       This greatly reduces the need for manual tuning of the background
       writer.
     * Per-field and per-row storage overhead have been reduced (Greg
       Stark, Heikki Linnakangas)
       Variable-length data types with data values less than 128 bytes
       long will see a storage decrease of 3 to 6 bytes. For example, two
       adjacent char(1) fields now use 4 bytes instead of 16. Row headers
       are also 4 bytes shorter than before.
     * Using non-persistent transaction IDs for read-only transactions
       reduces overhead and "VACUUM" requirements (Florian Pflug)
       Non-persistent transaction IDs do not increment the global
       transaction counter. Therefore, they reduce the load on pg_clog and
       increase the time between forced vacuums to prevent transaction ID
       wraparound. Other performance improvements were also made that
       should improve concurrency.
     * Avoid incrementing the command counter after a read-only command
       (Tom)
       There was formerly a hard limit of 2^32 (4 billion) commands per
       transaction. Now only commands that actually changed the database
       count, so while this limit still exists, it should be significantly
       less annoying.
     * Create a dedicated WAL writer process to off-load work from
       backends (Simon)
     * Skip unnecessary WAL writes for "CLUSTER" and "COPY" (Simon)
       Unless WAL archiving is enabled, the system now avoids WAL writes
       for "CLUSTER" and just fsync()s the table at the end of the
       command. It also does the same for "COPY" if the table was created
       in the same transaction.
     * Large sequential scans no longer force out frequently used cached
       pages (Simon, Heikki, Tom)
     * Concurrent large sequential scans can now share disk reads (Jeff
       Davis)
       This is accomplished by starting the new sequential scan in the
       middle of the table (where another sequential scan is already
       in-progress) and wrapping around to the beginning to finish. This
       can affect the order of returned rows in a query that does not
       specify ORDER BY. The synchronize_seqscans configuration parameter
       can be used to disable this if necessary.
     * ORDER BY ... LIMIT can be done without sorting (Greg Stark)
       This is done by sequentially scanning the table and tracking just
       the "top N" candidate rows, rather than performing a full sort of
       the entire table. This is useful when there is no matching index
       and the LIMIT is not large.
     * Put a rate limit on messages sent to the statistics collector by
       backends (Tom)
       This reduces overhead for short transactions, but might sometimes
       increase the delay before statistics are tallied.
     * Improve hash join performance for cases with many NULLs (Tom)
     * Speed up operator lookup for cases with non-exact datatype matches
       (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server

     * Autovacuum is now enabled by default (Alvaro)
       Several changes were made to eliminate disadvantages of having
       autovacuum enabled, thereby justifying the change in default.
       Several other autovacuum parameter defaults were also modified.
     * Support multiple concurrent autovacuum processes (Alvaro, Itagaki
       Takahiro)
       This allows multiple vacuums to run concurrently. This prevents
       vacuuming of a large table from delaying vacuuming of smaller
       tables.
     * Automatically re-plan cached queries when table definitions change
       or statistics are updated (Tom)
       Previously PL/PgSQL functions that referenced temporary tables
       would fail if the temporary table was dropped and recreated between
       function invocations, unless EXECUTE was used. This improvement
       fixes that problem and many related issues.
     * Add a temp_tablespaces parameter to control the tablespaces for
       temporary tables and files (Jaime Casanova, Albert Cervera, Bernd
       Helmle)
       This parameter defines a list of tablespaces to be used. This
       enables spreading the I/O load across multiple tablespaces. A
       random tablespace is chosen each time a temporary object is
       created. Temporary files are no longer stored in per-database
       "pgsql_tmp/" directories but in per-tablespace directories.
     * Place temporary tables' TOAST tables in special schemas named
       pg_toast_temp_nnn (Tom)
       This allows low-level code to recognize these tables as temporary,
       which enables various optimizations such as not WAL-logging changes
       and using local rather than shared buffers for access. This also
       fixes a bug wherein backends unexpectedly held open file references
       to temporary TOAST tables.
     * Fix problem that a constant flow of new connection requests could
       indefinitely delay the postmaster from completing a shutdown or a
       crash restart (Tom)
     * Guard against a very-low-probability data loss scenario by
       preventing re-use of a deleted table's relfilenode until after the
       next checkpoint (Heikki)
     * Fix "CREATE CONSTRAINT TRIGGER" to convert old-style foreign key
       trigger definitions into regular foreign key constraints (Tom)
       This will ease porting of foreign key constraints carried forward
       from pre-7.3 databases, if they were never converted using
       "contrib/adddepend".
     * Fix DEFAULT NULL to override inherited defaults (Tom)
       DEFAULT NULL was formerly considered a noise phrase, but it should
       (and now does) override non-null defaults that would otherwise be
       inherited from a parent table or domain.
     * Add new encodings EUC_JIS_2004 and SHIFT_JIS_2004 (Tatsuo)
       These new encodings can be converted to and from UTF-8.
     * Change server startup log message from "database system is ready"
       to "database system is ready to accept connections", and adjust its
       timing
       The message now appears only when the postmaster is really ready to
       accept connections.
     __________________________________________________________________

Monitoring

     * Add log_autovacuum_min_duration parameter to support configurable
       logging of autovacuum activity (Simon, Alvaro)
     * Add log_lock_waits parameter to log lock waiting (Simon)
     * Add log_temp_files parameter to log temporary file usage (Bill
       Moran)
     * Add log_checkpoints parameter to improve logging of checkpoints
       (Greg Smith, Heikki)
     * log_line_prefix now supports %s and %c escapes in all processes
       (Andrew)
       Previously these escapes worked only for user sessions, not for
       background database processes.
     * Add log_restartpoints to control logging of point-in-time recovery
       restart points (Simon)
     * Last transaction end time is now logged at end of recovery and at
       each logged restart point (Simon)
     * Autovacuum now reports its activity start time in pg_stat_activity
       (Tom)
     * Allow server log output in comma-separated value (CSV) format (Arul
       Shaji, Greg Smith, Andrew Dunstan)
       CSV-format log files can easily be loaded into a database table for
       subsequent analysis.
     * Use PostgreSQL-supplied timezone support for formatting timestamps
       displayed in the server log (Tom)
       This avoids Windows-specific problems with localized time zone
       names that are in the wrong encoding. There is a new log_timezone
       parameter that controls the timezone used in log messages,
       independently of the client-visible timezone parameter.
     * New system view pg_stat_bgwriter displays statistics about
       background writer activity (Magnus)
     * Add new columns for database-wide tuple statistics to
       pg_stat_database (Magnus)
     * Add an xact_start (transaction start time) column to
       pg_stat_activity (Neil)
       This makes it easier to identify long-running transactions.
     * Add n_live_tuples and n_dead_tuples columns to pg_stat_all_tables
       and related views (Glen Parker)
     * Merge stats_block_level and stats_row_level parameters into a
       single parameter track_counts, which controls all messages sent to
       the statistics collector process (Tom)
     * Rename stats_command_string parameter to track_activities (Tom)
     * Fix statistical counting of live and dead tuples to recognize that
       committed and aborted transactions have different effects (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Authentication

     * Support Security Service Provider Interface (SSPI) for
       authentication on Windows (Magnus)
     * Support GSSAPI authentication (Henry Hotz, Magnus)
       This should be preferred to native Kerberos authentication because
       GSSAPI is an industry standard.
     * Support a global SSL configuration file (Victor Wagner)
     * Add ssl_ciphers parameter to control accepted SSL ciphers (Victor
       Wagner)
     * Add a Kerberos realm parameter, krb_realm (Magnus)
     __________________________________________________________________

Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and Continuous Archiving

     * Change the timestamps recorded in transaction WAL records from
       time_t to TimestampTz representation (Tom)
       This provides sub-second resolution in WAL, which can be useful for
       point-in-time recovery.
     * Reduce WAL disk space needed by warm standby servers (Simon)
       This change allows a warm standby server to pass the name of the
       earliest still-needed WAL file to the recovery script, allowing
       automatic removal of no-longer-needed WAL files. This is done using
       %r in the restore_command parameter of "recovery.conf".
     * New boolean configuration parameter, archive_mode, controls
       archiving (Simon)
       Previously setting archive_command to an empty string turned off
       archiving. Now archive_mode turns archiving on and off,
       independently of archive_command. This is useful for stopping
       archiving temporarily.
     __________________________________________________________________

Queries

     * Full text search is integrated into the core database system
       (Teodor, Oleg)
       Text search has been improved, moved into the core code, and is now
       installed by default. "contrib/tsearch2" now contains a
       compatibility interface.
     * Add control over whether NULLs sort first or last (Teodor, Tom)
       The syntax is ORDER BY ... NULLS FIRST/LAST.
     * Allow per-column ascending/descending (ASC/DESC) ordering options
       for indexes (Teodor, Tom)
       Previously a query using ORDER BY with mixed ASC/DESC specifiers
       could not fully use an index. Now an index can be fully used in
       such cases if the index was created with matching ASC/DESC
       specifications. NULL sort order within an index can be controlled,
       too.
     * Allow col IS NULL to use an index (Teodor)
     * Updatable cursors (Arul Shaji, Tom)
       This eliminates the need to reference a primary key to "UPDATE" or
       "DELETE" rows returned by a cursor. The syntax is UPDATE/DELETE
       WHERE CURRENT OF.
     * Allow FOR UPDATE in cursors (Arul Shaji, Tom)
     * Create a general mechanism that supports casts to and from the
       standard string types (TEXT, VARCHAR, CHAR) for *every* datatype,
       by invoking the datatype's I/O functions (Tom)
       Previously, such casts were available only for types that had
       specialized function(s) for the purpose. These new casts are
       assignment-only in the to-string direction, explicit-only in the
       other direction, and therefore should create no surprising
       behavior.
     * Allow UNION and related constructs to return a domain type, when
       all inputs are of that domain type (Tom)
       Formerly, the output would be considered to be of the domain's base
       type.
     * Allow limited hashing when using two different data types (Tom)
       This allows hash joins, hash indexes, hashed subplans, and hash
       aggregation to be used in situations involving cross-data-type
       comparisons, if the data types have compatible hash functions.
       Currently, cross-data-type hashing support exists for
       smallint/integer/bigint, and for float4/float8.
     * Improve optimizer logic for detecting when variables are equal in a
       WHERE clause (Tom)
       This allows mergejoins to work with descending sort orders, and
       improves recognition of redundant sort columns.
     * Improve performance when planning large inheritance trees in cases
       where most tables are excluded by constraints (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation

     * Arrays of composite types (David Fetter, Andrew, Tom)
       In addition to arrays of explicitly-declared composite types,
       arrays of the rowtypes of regular tables and views are now
       supported, except for rowtypes of system catalogs, sequences, and
       TOAST tables.
     * Server configuration parameters can now be set on a per-function
       basis (Tom)
       For example, functions can now set their own search_path to prevent
       unexpected behavior if a different search_path exists at run-time.
       Security definer functions should set search_path to avoid security
       loopholes.
     * "CREATE/ALTER FUNCTION" now supports COST and ROWS options (Tom)
       COST allows specification of the cost of a function call. ROWS
       allows specification of the average number or rows returned by a
       set-returning function. These values are used by the optimizer in
       choosing the best plan.
     * Implement "CREATE TABLE LIKE ... INCLUDING INDEXES" (Trevor
       Hardcastle, Nikhil Sontakke, Neil)
     * Allow "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY" to ignore transactions in other
       databases (Simon)
     * Add "ALTER VIEW ... RENAME TO" and "ALTER SEQUENCE ... RENAME TO"
       (David Fetter, Neil)
       Previously this could only be done via "ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO".
     * Make "CREATE/DROP/RENAME DATABASE" wait briefly for conflicting
       backends to exit before failing (Tom)
       This increases the likelihood that these commands will succeed.
     * Allow triggers and rules to be deactivated in groups using a
       configuration parameter, for replication purposes (Jan)
       This allows replication systems to disable triggers and rewrite
       rules as a group without modifying the system catalogs directly.
       The behavior is controlled by "ALTER TABLE" and a new parameter
       session_replication_role.
     * User-defined types can now have type modifiers (Teodor, Tom)
       This allows a user-defined type to take a modifier, like ssnum(7).
       Previously only built-in data types could have modifiers.
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Commands

     * Non-superuser database owners now are able to add trusted
       procedural languages to their databases by default (Jeremy Drake)
       While this is reasonably safe, some administrators might wish to
       revoke the privilege. It is controlled by
       pg_pltemplate.tmpldbacreate.
     * Allow a session's current parameter setting to be used as the
       default for future sessions (Tom)
       This is done with SET ... FROM CURRENT in "CREATE/ALTER FUNCTION",
       "ALTER DATABASE", or "ALTER ROLE".
     * Implement new commands "DISCARD ALL", "DISCARD PLANS", "DISCARD
       TEMPORARY", "CLOSE ALL", and "DEALLOCATE ALL" (Marko Kreen, Neil)
       These commands simplify resetting a database session to its initial
       state, and are particularly useful for connection-pooling software.
     * Make "CLUSTER" MVCC-safe (Heikki Linnakangas)
       Formerly, "CLUSTER" would discard all tuples that were committed
       dead, even if there were still transactions that should be able to
       see them under MVCC visibility rules.
     * Add new "CLUSTER" syntax: CLUSTER table USING index (Holger
       Schurig)
       The old "CLUSTER" syntax is still supported, but the new form is
       considered more logical.
     * Fix "EXPLAIN" so it can show complex plans more accurately (Tom)
       References to subplan outputs are now always shown correctly,
       instead of using ?columnN? for complicated cases.
     * Limit the amount of information reported when a user is dropped
       (Alvaro)
       Previously, dropping (or attempting to drop) a user who owned many
       objects could result in large NOTICE or ERROR messages listing all
       these objects; this caused problems for some client applications.
       The length of the message is now limited, although a full list is
       still sent to the server log.
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Types

     * Support for the SQL/XML standard, including new operators and an
       XML data type (Nikolay Samokhvalov, Pavel Stehule, Peter)
     * Enumerated data types (ENUM) (Tom Dunstan)
       This feature provides convenient support for fields that have a
       small, fixed set of allowed values. An example of creating an ENUM
       type is CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ('sad', 'ok', 'happy').
     * Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) data type (Gevik Babakhani,
       Neil)
       This closely matches RFC 4122.
     * Widen the MONEY data type to 64 bits (D'Arcy Cain)
       This greatly increases the range of supported MONEY values.
     * Fix float4/float8 to handle Infinity and NAN (Not A Number)
       consistently (Bruce)
       The code formerly was not consistent about distinguishing Infinity
       from overflow conditions.
     * Allow leading and trailing whitespace during input of boolean
       values (Neil)
     * Prevent "COPY" from using digits and lowercase letters as
       delimiters (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Functions

     * Add new regular expression functions regexp_matches(),
       regexp_split_to_array(), and regexp_split_to_table() (Jeremy Drake,
       Neil)
       These functions provide extraction of regular expression
       subexpressions and allow splitting a string using a POSIX regular
       expression.
     * Add lo_truncate() for large object truncation (Kris Jurka)
     * Implement width_bucket() for the float8 data type (Neil)
     * Add pg_stat_clear_snapshot() to discard statistics snapshots
       collected during the current transaction (Tom)
       The first request for statistics in a transaction takes a
       statistics snapshot that does not change during the transaction.
       This function allows the snapshot to be discarded and a new
       snapshot loaded during the next statistics query. This is
       particularly useful for PL/PgSQL functions, which are confined to a
       single transaction.
     * Add isodow option to EXTRACT() and date_part() (Bruce)
       This returns the day of the week, with Sunday as seven. (dow
       returns Sunday as zero.)
     * Add ID (ISO day of week) and IDDD (ISO day of year) format codes
       for to_char(), to_date(), and to_timestamp() (Brendan Jurd)
     * Make to_timestamp() and to_date() assume TM (trim) option for
       potentially variable-width fields (Bruce)
       This matches Oracle's behavior.
     * Fix off-by-one conversion error in to_date()/to_timestamp() D
       (non-ISO day of week) fields (Bruce)
     * Make setseed() return void, rather than a useless integer value
       (Neil)
     * Add a hash function for NUMERIC (Neil)
       This allows hash indexes and hash-based plans to be used with
       NUMERIC columns.
     * Improve efficiency of LIKE/ILIKE, especially for multi-byte
       character sets like UTF-8 (Andrew, Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Make currtid() functions require SELECT privileges on the target
       table (Tom)
     * Add several txid_*() functions to query active transaction IDs
       (Jan)
       This is useful for various replication solutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/PgSQL Server-Side Language

     * Add scrollable cursor support, including directional control in
       "FETCH" (Pavel Stehule)
     * Allow IN as an alternative to FROM in PL/PgSQL's "FETCH" statement,
       for consistency with the backend's "FETCH" command (Pavel Stehule)
     * Add "MOVE" to PL/PgSQL (Magnus, Pavel Stehule, Neil)
     * Implement "RETURN QUERY" (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
       This adds convenient syntax for PL/PgSQL set-returning functions
       that want to return the result of a query. "RETURN QUERY" is easier
       and more efficient than a loop around "RETURN NEXT".
     * Allow function parameter names to be qualified with the function's
       name (Tom)
       For example, myfunc.myvar. This is particularly useful for
       specifying variables in a query where the variable name might match
       a column name.
     * Make qualification of variables with block labels work properly
       (Tom)
       Formerly, outer-level block labels could unexpectedly interfere
       with recognition of inner-level record or row references.
     * Tighten requirements for FOR loop STEP values (Tom)
       Prevent non-positive STEP values, and handle loop overflows.
     * Improve accuracy when reporting syntax error locations (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Other Server-Side Languages

     * Allow type-name arguments to PL/Perl spi_prepare() to be data type
       aliases in addition to names found in pg_type (Andrew)
     * Allow type-name arguments to PL/Python plpy.prepare() to be data
       type aliases in addition to names found in pg_type (Andrew)
     * Allow type-name arguments to PL/Tcl spi_prepare to be data type
       aliases in addition to names found in pg_type (Andrew)
     * Enable PL/PythonU to compile on Python 2.5 (Marko Kreen)
     * Support a true PL/Python boolean type in compatible Python versions
       (Python 2.3 and later) (Marko Kreen)
     * Fix PL/Tcl problems with thread-enabled "libtcl" spawning multiple
       threads within the backend (Steve Marshall, Paul Bayer, Doug
       Knight)
       This caused all sorts of unpleasantness.
     __________________________________________________________________

psql

     * List disabled triggers separately in \d output (Brendan Jurd)
     * In \d patterns, always match $ literally (Tom)
     * Show aggregate return types in \da output (Greg Sabino Mullane)
     * Add the function's volatility status to the output of \df+ (Neil)
     * Add \prompt capability (Chad Wagner)
     * Allow \pset, \t, and \x to specify on or off, rather than just
       toggling (Chad Wagner)
     * Add \sleep capability (Jan)
     * Enable \timing output for \copy (Andrew)
     * Improve \timing resolution on Windows (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Flush \o output after each backslash command (Tom)
     * Correctly detect and report errors while reading a -f input file
       (Peter)
     * Remove -u option (this option has long been deprecated) (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump

     * Add --tablespaces-only and --roles-only options to pg_dumpall (Dave
       Page)
     * Add an output file option to pg_dumpall (Dave Page)
       This is primarily useful on Windows, where output redirection of
       child pg_dump processes does not work.
     * Allow pg_dumpall to accept an initial-connection database name
       rather than the default template1 (Dave Page)
     * In -n and -t switches, always match $ literally (Tom)
     * Improve performance when a database has thousands of objects (Tom)
     * Remove -u option (this option has long been deprecated) (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Other Client Applications

     * In initdb, allow the location of the "pg_xlog" directory to be
       specified (Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     * Enable server core dump generation in pg_regress on supported
       operating systems (Andrew)
     * Add a -t (timeout) parameter to pg_ctl (Bruce)
       This controls how long pg_ctl will wait when waiting for server
       startup or shutdown. Formerly the timeout was hard-wired as 60
       seconds.
     * Add a pg_ctl option to control generation of server core dumps
       (Andrew)
     * Allow Control-C to cancel clusterdb, reindexdb, and vacuumdb
       (Itagaki Takahiro, Magnus)
     * Suppress command tag output for createdb, createuser, dropdb, and
       dropuser (Peter)
       The --quiet option is ignored and will be removed in 8.4. Progress
       messages when acting on all databases now go to stdout instead of
       stderr because they are not actually errors.
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq

     * Interpret the dbName parameter of PQsetdbLogin() as a conninfo
       string if it contains an equals sign (Andrew)
       This allows use of conninfo strings in client programs that still
       use PQsetdbLogin().
     * Support a global SSL configuration file (Victor Wagner)
     * Add environment variable PGSSLKEY to control SSL hardware keys
       (Victor Wagner)
     * Add lo_truncate() for large object truncation (Kris Jurka)
     * Add PQconnectionNeedsPassword() that returns true if the server
       required a password but none was supplied (Joe Conway, Tom)
       If this returns true after a failed connection attempt, a client
       application should prompt the user for a password. In the past
       applications have had to check for a specific error message string
       to decide whether a password is needed; that approach is now
       deprecated.
     * Add PQconnectionUsedPassword() that returns true if the supplied
       password was actually used (Joe Conway, Tom)
       This is useful in some security contexts where it is important to
       know whether a user-supplied password is actually valid.
     __________________________________________________________________

ecpg

     * Use V3 frontend/backend protocol (Michael)
       This adds support for server-side prepared statements.
     * Use native threads, instead of pthreads, on Windows (Magnus)
     * Improve thread-safety of ecpglib (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Make the ecpg libraries export only necessary API symbols (Michael)
     __________________________________________________________________

Windows Port

     * Allow the whole PostgreSQL distribution to be compiled with
       Microsoft Visual C++ (Magnus and others)
       This allows Windows-based developers to use familiar development
       and debugging tools. Windows executables made with Visual C++ might
       also have better stability and performance than those made with
       other tool sets. The client-only Visual C++ build scripts have been
       removed.
     * Drastically reduce postmaster's memory usage when it has many child
       processes (Magnus)
     * Allow regression tests to be started by an administrative user
       (Magnus)
     * Add native shared memory implementation (Magnus)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Programming Interface (SPI)

     * Add cursor-related functionality in SPI (Pavel Stehule)
       Allow access to the cursor-related planning options, and add
       "FETCH"/"MOVE" routines.
     * Allow execution of cursor commands through SPI_execute (Tom)
       The macro SPI_ERROR_CURSOR still exists but will never be returned.
     * SPI plan pointers are now declared as SPIPlanPtr instead of void *
       (Tom)
       This does not break application code, but switching is recommended
       to help catch simple programming mistakes.
     __________________________________________________________________

Build Options

     * Add configure option --enable-profiling to enable code profiling
       (works only with gcc) (Korry Douglas and Nikhil Sontakke)
     * Add configure option --with-system-tzdata to use the operating
       system's time zone database (Peter)
     * Fix PGXS so extensions can be built against PostgreSQL
       installations whose pg_config program does not appear first in the
       PATH (Tom)
     * Support "gmake draft" when building the SGML documentation (Bruce)
       Unless draft is used, the documentation build will now be repeated
       if necessary to ensure the index is up-to-date.
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code

     * Rename macro DLLIMPORT to PGDLLIMPORT to avoid conflicting with
       third party includes (like Tcl) that define DLLIMPORT (Magnus)
     * Create "operator families" to improve planning of queries involving
       cross-data-type comparisons (Tom)
     * Update GIN extractQuery() API to allow signalling that nothing can
       satisfy the query (Teodor)
     * Move NAMEDATALEN definition from "postgres_ext.h" to
       "pg_config_manual.h" (Peter)
     * Provide strlcpy() and strlcat() on all platforms, and replace
       error-prone uses of strncpy(), strncat(), etc (Peter)
     * Create hooks to let an external plugin monitor (or even replace)
       the planner and create plans for hypothetical situations (Gurjeet
       Singh, Tom)
     * Create a function variable join_search_hook to let plugins override
       the join search order portion of the planner (Julius Stroffek)
     * Add tas() support for Renesas' M32R processor (Kazuhiro Inaoka)
     * quote_identifier() and pg_dump no longer quote keywords that are
       unreserved according to the grammar (Tom)
     * Change the on-disk representation of the NUMERIC data type so that
       the sign_dscale word comes before the weight (Tom)
     * Use SYSV semaphores rather than POSIX on Darwin >= 6.0, i.e., OS X
       10.2 and up (Chris Marcellino)
     * Add acronym and NFS documentation sections (Bruce)
     * "Postgres" is now documented as an accepted alias for "PostgreSQL"
       (Peter)
     * Add documentation about preventing database server spoofing when
       the server is down (Bruce)
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib

     * Move "contrib" "README" content into the main PostgreSQL
       documentation (Albert Cervera i Areny)
     * Add "contrib/pageinspect" module for low-level page inspection
       (Simon, Heikki)
     * Add "contrib/pg_standby" module for controlling warm standby
       operation (Simon)
     * Add "contrib/uuid-ossp" module for generating UUID values using the
       OSSP UUID library (Peter)
       Use configure --with-ossp-uuid to activate. This takes advantage of
       the new UUID builtin type.
     * Add "contrib/dict_int", "contrib/dict_xsyn", and
       "contrib/test_parser" modules to provide sample add-on text search
       dictionary templates and parsers (Sergey Karpov)
     * Allow contrib/pgbench to set the fillfactor (Pavan Deolasee)
     * Add timestamps to contrib/pgbench -l (Greg Smith)
     * Add usage count statistics to "contrib/pgbuffercache" (Greg Smith)
     * Add GIN support for "contrib/hstore" (Teodor)
     * Add GIN support for "contrib/pg_trgm" (Guillaume Smet, Teodor)
     * Update OS/X startup scripts in "contrib/start-scripts" (Mark
       Cotner, David Fetter)
     * Restrict pgrowlocks() and dblink_get_pkey() to users who have
       SELECT privilege on the target table (Tom)
     * Restrict "contrib/pgstattuple" functions to superusers (Tom)
     * "contrib/xml2" is deprecated and planned for removal in 8.4 (Peter)
       The new XML support in core PostgreSQL supersedes this module.

                               Release 8.2.15

     Release date: 2009-12-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.14. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.15

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.14, see the release notes
   for 8.2.14.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
       changing session-local state (Gurjeet Singh, Tom)
       This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions from
       possibly subverting a superuser's session (CVE-2009-4136).
     * Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
       common name (CN) field (Magnus)
       This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a server or
       client name during SSL validation (CVE-2009-4034).
     * Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization
       (Tom)
     * Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)
       This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's
       already committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
       if a plain VACUUM is interrupted after having truncated the table.
     * Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
       calculation (Tom)
       This could occur with extremely large planner estimates for the
       size of a hashjoin's result.
     * Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons (Chris Mikkelson)
     * Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared transactions
       are not ignored (Heikki)
     * Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
       accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
     * Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the split
       depends on a non-first column of the index (Paul Ramsey)
     * Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file fails at
       the end of checkpoint (Heikki)
       It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and allow the
       checkpoint to complete. Future checkpoints will retry the removal.
       Such problems are not expected in normal operation, but have been
       seen to be caused by misdesigned Windows anti-virus and backup
       software.
     * Ensure WAL files aren't repeatedly archived on Windows (Heikki)
       This is another symptom that could happen if some other process
       interfered with deletion of a no-longer-needed file.
     * Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)
       The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
       Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
       domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
       was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
       stack would pass to it.
     * Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
       FUNCTION (Tom)
     * Fix bug with calling plperl from plperlu or vice versa (Tom)
       An error exit from the inner function could result in crashes due
       to failure to re-select the correct Perl interpreter for the outer
       function.
     * Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function is
       redefined (Tom)
     * Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL arrays
       when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function (Andrew Dunstan,
       Abhijit Menon-Sen)
       This worked correctly already for non-set-returning functions.
     * Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python (Peter)
     * Ensure psql's flex module is compiled with the correct system
       header definitions (Tom)
       This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile
       causes incompatible changes in the generated code.
     * Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
       connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
       libpq versions (Tom)
     * Update the timezone abbreviation files to match current reality
       (Joachim Wieland)
       This includes adding IDT and SGT to the default timezone
       abbreviation set.
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
       changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji, Novokuznetsk,
       Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also historical corrections for
       Hong Kong.

                               Release 8.2.14

     Release date: 2009-09-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.13. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.14

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you
   have any hash indexes on interval columns, you must "REINDEX" them
   after updating to 8.2.14. Also, if you are upgrading from a version
   earlier than 8.2.11, see the release notes for 8.2.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Force WAL segment switch during pg_start_backup() (Heikki)
       This avoids corner cases that could render a base backup unusable.
     * Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)
       This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch that
       disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions. (See CVE-2007-6600)
     * Make "LOAD" of an already-loaded loadable module into a no-op (Tom)
       Formerly, "LOAD" would attempt to unload and re-load the module,
       but this is unsafe and not all that useful.
     * Disallow empty passwords during LDAP authentication (Magnus)
     * Fix handling of sub-SELECTs appearing in the arguments of an
       outer-level aggregate function (Tom)
     * Fix bugs associated with fetching a whole-row value from the output
       of a Sort or Materialize plan node (Tom)
     * Revert planner change that disabled partial-index and constraint
       exclusion optimizations when there were more than 100 clauses in an
       AND or OR list (Tom)
     * Fix hash calculation for data type interval (Tom)
       This corrects wrong results for hash joins on interval values. It
       also changes the contents of hash indexes on interval columns. If
       you have any such indexes, you must "REINDEX" them after updating.
     * Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
       'HH'/'HH12' (Heikki)
       It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
     * Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
       and integer datetimes are in use (Alex Hunsaker)
     * Fix calculation of distance between a point and a line segment
       (Tom)
       This led to incorrect results from a number of geometric operators.
     * Fix money data type to work in locales where currency amounts have
       no fractional digits, e.g. Japan (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Properly round datetime input like
       00:12:57.9999999999999999999999999999 (Tom)
     * Fix poor choice of page split point in GiST R-tree operator classes
       (Teodor)
     * Avoid performance degradation in bulk inserts into GIN indexes when
       the input values are (nearly) in sorted order (Tom)
     * Correctly enforce NOT NULL domain constraints in some contexts in
       PL/pgSQL (Tom)
     * Fix portability issues in plperl initialization (Andrew Dunstan)
     * Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
       empty (Jeff Davis)
     * Make "contrib/hstore" throw an error when a key or value is too
       long to fit in its data structure, rather than silently truncating
       it (Andrew Gierth)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
       number of parameters (twenty) (Tom)
     * Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
       "COPY FROM STDIN" (Tom)
     * Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
       both libraries are installed (Zdenek Kotala)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009l for DST law
       changes in Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Argentina/San_Luis,
       Cuba, Jordan (historical correction only), Mauritius, Morocco,
       Palestine, Syria, Tunisia.

                               Release 8.2.13

     Release date: 2009-03-16

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.12. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.13

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.11, see the release notes
   for 8.2.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails
       (Tom)
       This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
       related failure scenarios. The previous fixes were narrowly
       tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now
       recognized that *any* error thrown by an encoding conversion
       function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying
       to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable
       translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form
       of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive
       error reporting situation. (CVE-2009-0922)
     * Disallow "CREATE CONVERSION" with the wrong encodings for the
       specified conversion function (Heikki)
       This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion
       failure. The previous change is a backstop to guard against other
       kinds of failures in the same area.
     * Fix core dump when to_char() is given format codes that are
       inappropriate for the type of the data argument (Tom)
     * Fix possible failure in "contrib/tsearch2" when C locale is used
       with a multi-byte encoding (Teodor)
       Crashes were possible on platforms where wchar_t is narrower than
       int; Windows in particular.
     * Fix extreme inefficiency in "contrib/tsearch2" parser's handling of
       an email-like string containing multiple @ characters (Heikki)
     * Fix decompilation of CASE WHEN with an implicit coercion (Tom)
       This mistake could lead to Assert failures in an Assert-enabled
       build, or an "unexpected CASE WHEN clause" error message in other
       cases, when trying to examine or dump a view.
     * Fix possible misassignment of the owner of a TOAST table's rowtype
       (Tom)
       If "CLUSTER" or a rewriting variant of "ALTER TABLE" were executed
       by someone other than the table owner, the pg_type entry for the
       table's TOAST table would end up marked as owned by that someone.
       This caused no immediate problems, since the permissions on the
       TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any ordinary database operation.
       However, it could lead to unexpected failures if one later tried to
       drop the role that issued the command (in 8.1 or 8.2), or "owner of
       data type appears to be invalid" warnings from pg_dump after having
       done so (in 8.3).
     * Fix PL/pgSQL to not treat INTO after "INSERT" as an INTO-variables
       clause anywhere in the string, not only at the start; in
       particular, don't fail for "INSERT INTO" within "CREATE RULE" (Tom)
     * Clean up PL/pgSQL error status variables fully at block exit
       (Ashesh Vashi and Dave Page)
       This is not a problem for PL/pgSQL itself, but the omission could
       cause the PL/pgSQL Debugger to crash while examining the state of a
       function.
     * Retry failed calls to CallNamedPipe() on Windows (Steve Marshall,
       Magnus)
       It appears that this function can sometimes fail transiently; we
       previously treated any failure as a hard error, which could confuse
       "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" as well as other operations.
     * Add MUST (Mauritius Island Summer Time) to the default list of
       known timezone abbreviations (Xavier Bugaud)

   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.11, see the release notes
   for 8.2.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Improve handling of URLs in headline() function (Teodor)
     * Improve handling of overlength headlines in headline() function
       (Teodor)
     * Prevent possible Assert failure or misconversion if an encoding
       conversion is created with the wrong conversion function for the
       specified pair of encodings (Tom, Heikki)
     * Fix possible Assert failure if a statement executed in PL/pgSQL is
       rewritten into another kind of statement, for example if an
       "INSERT" is rewritten into an "UPDATE" (Heikki)
     * Ensure that a snapshot is available to datatype input functions
       (Tom)
       This primarily affects domains that are declared with CHECK
       constraints involving user-defined stable or immutable functions.
       Such functions typically fail if no snapshot has been set.
     * Make it safer for SPI-using functions to be used within datatype
       I/O; in particular, to be used in domain check constraints (Tom)
     * Avoid unnecessary locking of small tables in "VACUUM" (Heikki)
     * Fix a problem that made UPDATE RETURNING tableoid return zero
       instead of the correct OID (Tom)
     * Fix planner misestimation of selectivity when transitive equality
       is applied to an outer-join clause (Tom)
       This could result in bad plans for queries like ... from a left
       join b on a.a1 = b.b1 where a.a1 = 42 ...
     * Improve optimizer's handling of long IN lists (Tom)
       This change avoids wasting large amounts of time on such lists when
       constraint exclusion is enabled.
     * Ensure that the contents of a holdable cursor don't depend on the
       contents of TOAST tables (Tom)
       Previously, large field values in a cursor result might be
       represented as TOAST pointers, which would fail if the referenced
       table got dropped before the cursor is read, or if the large value
       is deleted and then vacuumed away. This cannot happen with an
       ordinary cursor, but it could with a cursor that is held past its
       creating transaction.
     * Fix memory leak when a set-returning function is terminated without
       reading its whole result (Tom)
     * Fix "contrib/dblink"'s dblink_get_result(text,bool) function (Joe)
     * Fix possible garbage output from "contrib/sslinfo" functions (Tom)
     * Fix configure script to properly report failure when unable to
       obtain linkage information for PL/Perl (Andrew)
     * Make all documentation reference pgsql-bugs and/or pgsql-hackers as
       appropriate, instead of the now-decommissioned pgsql-ports and
       pgsql-patches mailing lists (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009a (for Kathmandu

                               Release 8.2.11

     Release date: 2008-11-03

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.10. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.11

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.7, see the release notes
   for 8.2.7. Also, if you were running a previous 8.2.X release, it is
   recommended to "REINDEX" all GiST indexes after the upgrade.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix GiST index corruption due to marking the wrong index entry
       "dead" after a deletion (Teodor)
       This would result in index searches failing to find rows they
       should have found. Corrupted indexes can be fixed with "REINDEX".
     * Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a
       localized error message (Tom)
       We have addressed similar issues before, but it would still fail if
       the "character has no equivalent" message itself couldn't be
       converted. The fix is to disable localization and send the plain
       ASCII error message when we detect such a situation.
     * Fix possible crash when deeply nested functions are invoked from a
       trigger (Tom)
     * Improve optimization of "expression" IN ("expression-list") queries
       (Tom, per an idea from Robert Haas)
       Cases in which there are query variables on the right-hand side had
       been handled less efficiently in 8.2.x and 8.3.x than in prior
       versions. The fix restores 8.1 behavior for such cases.
     * Fix mis-expansion of rule queries when a sub-SELECT appears in a
       function call in FROM, a multi-row VALUES list, or a RETURNING list
       (Tom)
       The usual symptom of this problem is an "unrecognized node type"
       error.
     * Fix memory leak during rescan of a hashed aggregation plan (Neil)
     * Ensure an error is reported when a newly-defined PL/pgSQL trigger
       function is invoked as a normal function (Tom)
     * Prevent possible collision of relfilenode numbers when moving a
       table to another tablespace with "ALTER SET TABLESPACE" (Heikki)
       The command tried to re-use the existing filename, instead of
       picking one that is known unused in the destination directory.
     * Fix incorrect tsearch2 headline generation when single query item
       matches first word of text (Sushant Sinha)
     * Fix improper display of fractional seconds in interval values when
       using a non-ISO datestyle in an "--enable-integer-datetimes" build
       (Ron Mayer)
     * Ensure SPI_getvalue and SPI_getbinval behave correctly when the
       passed tuple and tuple descriptor have different numbers of columns
       (Tom)
       This situation is normal when a table has had columns added or
       removed, but these two functions didn't handle it properly. The
       only likely consequence is an incorrect error indication.
     * Fix ecpg's parsing of "CREATE ROLE" (Michael)
     * Fix recent breakage of pg_ctl restart (Tom)
     * Ensure "pg_control" is opened in binary mode (Itagaki Takahiro)
       pg_controldata and pg_resetxlog did this incorrectly, and so could
       fail on Windows.
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008i (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Brazil, Mauritius, Syria)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.2.10

     Release date: 2008-09-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.9. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.10

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.7, see the release notes
   for 8.2.7.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix bug in btree WAL recovery code (Heikki)
       Recovery failed if the WAL ended partway through a page split
       operation.
     * Fix potential miscalculation of datfrozenxid (Alvaro)
       This error may explain some recent reports of failure to remove old
       pg_clog data.
     * Widen local lock counters from 32 to 64 bits (Tom)
       This responds to reports that the counters could overflow in
       sufficiently long transactions, leading to unexpected "lock is
       already held" errors.
     * Fix possible duplicate output of tuples during a GiST index scan
       (Teodor)
     * Fix missed permissions checks when a view contains a simple UNION
       ALL construct (Heikki)
       Permissions for the referenced tables were checked properly, but
       not permissions for the view itself.
     * Add checks in executor startup to ensure that the tuples produced
       by an "INSERT" or "UPDATE" will match the target table's current
       rowtype (Tom)
       "ALTER COLUMN TYPE", followed by re-use of a previously cached
       plan, could produce this type of situation. The check protects
       against data corruption and/or crashes that could ensue.
     * Fix possible repeated drops during "DROP OWNED" (Tom)
       This would typically result in strange errors such as "cache lookup
       failed for relation NNN".
     * Fix AT TIME ZONE to first try to interpret its timezone argument as
       a timezone abbreviation, and only try it as a full timezone name if
       that fails, rather than the other way around as formerly (Tom)
       The timestamp input functions have always resolved ambiguous zone
       names in this order. Making AT TIME ZONE do so as well improves
       consistency, and fixes a compatibility bug introduced in 8.1: in
       ambiguous cases we now behave the same as 8.0 and before did, since
       in the older versions AT TIME ZONE accepted *only* abbreviations.
     * Fix datetime input functions to correctly detect integer overflow
       when running on a 64-bit platform (Tom)
     * Prevent integer overflows during units conversion when displaying a
       configuration parameter that has units (Tom)
     * Improve performance of writing very long log messages to syslog
       (Tom)
     * Allow spaces in the suffix part of an LDAP URL in "pg_hba.conf"
       (Tom)
     * Fix bug in backwards scanning of a cursor on a SELECT DISTINCT ON
       query (Tom)
     * Fix planner bug with nested sub-select expressions (Tom)
       If the outer sub-select has no direct dependency on the parent
       query, but the inner one does, the outer value might not get
       recalculated for new parent query rows.
     * Fix planner to estimate that GROUP BY expressions yielding boolean
       results always result in two groups, regardless of the expressions'
       contents (Tom)
       This is very substantially more accurate than the regular GROUP BY
       estimate for certain boolean tests like "col" IS NULL.
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to not fail when a FOR loop's target variable is a
       record containing composite-type fields (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Tcl to behave correctly with Tcl 8.5, and to be more careful
       about the encoding of data sent to or from Tcl (Tom)
     * On Windows, work around a Microsoft bug by preventing libpq from
       trying to send more than 64kB per system call (Magnus)
     * Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's error reporting after failure to
       send a SQL command (Tom)
     * Fix pg_ctl to properly preserve postmaster command-line arguments
       across a restart (Bruce)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008f (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Mauritius, Morocco,
       Pakistan, Palestine, and Paraguay)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.2.9

     Release date: 2008-06-12

   This release contains one serious and one minor bug fix over 8.2.8. For
   information about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the
   Section called Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.9

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.7, see the release notes
   for 8.2.7.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Make pg_get_ruledef() parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
       Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be
       dumped as, say, -42::integer, which is subtly incorrect: it should
       be (-42)::integer due to operator precedence rules. Usually this
       would make little difference, but it could interact with another
       recent patch to cause PostgreSQL to reject what had been a valid
       "SELECT DISTINCT" view query. Since this could result in pg_dump
       output failing to reload, it is being treated as a high-priority
       fix. The only released versions in which dump output is actually
       incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.
     * Make "ALTER AGGREGATE ... OWNER TO" update pg_shdepend (Tom)
       This oversight could lead to problems if the aggregate was later
       involved in a "DROP OWNED" or "REASSIGN OWNED" operation.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.2.8

     Release date: never released

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.7. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.7, see the release notes
   for 8.2.7.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix ERRORDATA_STACK_SIZE exceeded crash that occurred on Windows
       when using UTF-8 database encoding and a different client encoding
       (Tom)
     * Fix "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ... PRIMARY KEY" so that the new column
       is correctly checked to see if it's been initialized to all
       non-nulls (Brendan Jurd)
       Previous versions neglected to check this requirement at all.
     * Fix possible "CREATE TABLE" failure when inheriting the "same"
       constraint from multiple parent relations that inherited that
       constraint from a common ancestor (Tom)
     * Fix pg_get_ruledef() to show the alias, if any, attached to the
       target table of an "UPDATE" or "DELETE" (Tom)
     * Fix GIN bug that could result in a too many LWLocks taken failure
       (Teodor)
     * Avoid possible crash when decompressing corrupted data (Zdenek
       Kotala)
     * Repair two places where SIGTERM exit of a backend could leave
       corrupted state in shared memory (Tom)
       Neither case is very important if SIGTERM is used to shut down the
       whole database cluster together, but there was a problem if someone
       tried to SIGTERM individual backends.
     * Fix conversions between ISO-8859-5 and other encodings to handle
       Cyrillic "Yo" characters (e and E with two dots) (Sergey Burladyan)
     * Fix several datatype input functions, notably array_in(), that were
       allowing unused bytes in their results to contain uninitialized,
       unpredictable values (Tom)
       This could lead to failures in which two apparently identical
       literal values were not seen as equal, resulting in the parser
       complaining about unmatched ORDER BY and DISTINCT expressions.
     * Fix a corner case in regular-expression substring matching
       (substring(string from pattern)) (Tom)
       The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
       the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
       subexpression hasn't got a match. An example is substring('foo'
       from 'foo(bar)?'). This should return NULL, since (bar) isn't
       matched, but it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match
       instead (ie, foo).
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008c (for DST law
       changes in Morocco, Iraq, Choibalsan, Pakistan, Syria, Cuba, and
       Argentina/San_Luis)
     * Fix incorrect result from ecpg's PGTYPEStimestamp_sub() function
       (Michael)
     * Fix broken GiST comparison function for "contrib/tsearch2"'s
       tsquery type (Teodor)
     * Fix possible crashes in "contrib/cube" functions (Tom)
     * Fix core dump in "contrib/xml2"'s xpath_table() function when the
       input query returns a NULL value (Tom)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s makefile to not override CFLAGS (Tom)
     * Fix DatumGetBool macro to not fail with gcc 4.3 (Tom)
       This problem affects "old style" (V0) C functions that return
       boolean. The fix is already in 8.3, but the need to back-patch it
       was not realized at the time.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.2.7

     Release date: 2008-03-17

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.6. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, you
   might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns after updating, if
   you are affected by the Windows locale issue described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix character string comparison for Windows locales that consider
       different character combinations as equal (Tom)
       This fix applies only on Windows and only when using UTF-8 database
       encoding. The same fix was made for all other cases over two years
       ago, but Windows with UTF-8 uses a separate code path that was not
       updated. If you are using a locale that considers some
       non-identical strings as equal, you may need to "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns.
     * Repair potential deadlock between concurrent "VACUUM FULL"
       operations on different system catalogs (Tom)
     * Fix longstanding "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" race condition (Tom)
       In rare cases a session that had just executed a "LISTEN" might not
       get a notification, even though one would be expected because the
       concurrent transaction executing "NOTIFY" was observed to commit
       later.
       A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed a
       not-yet-committed "LISTEN" command will not see any row in
       pg_listener for the "LISTEN", should it choose to look; formerly it
       would have. This behavior was never documented one way or the
       other, but it is possible that some applications depend on the old
       behavior.
     * Disallow "LISTEN" and "UNLISTEN" within a prepared transaction
       (Tom)
       This was formerly allowed but trying to do it had various
       unpleasant consequences, notably that the originating backend could
       not exit as long as an "UNLISTEN" remained uncommitted.
     * Disallow dropping a temporary table within a prepared transaction
       (Heikki)
       This was correctly disallowed by 8.1, but the check was
       inadvertently broken in 8.2.
     * Fix rare crash when an error occurs during a query using a hash
       index (Heikki)
     * Fix memory leaks in certain usages of set-returning functions
       (Neil)
     * Fix input of datetime values for February 29 in years BC (Tom)
       The former coding was mistaken about which years were leap years.
     * Fix "unrecognized node type" error in some variants of "ALTER
       OWNER" (Tom)
     * Ensure pg_stat_activity.waiting flag is cleared when a lock wait is
       aborted (Tom)
     * Fix handling of process permissions on Windows Vista (Dave, Magnus)
       In particular, this fix allows starting the server as the
       Administrator user.
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008a (in particular,
       recent Chile changes); adjust timezone abbreviation VET (Venezuela)
       to mean UTC-4:30, not UTC-4:00 (Tom)
     * Fix pg_ctl to correctly extract the postmaster's port number from
       command-line options (Itagaki Takahiro, Tom)
       Previously, pg_ctl start -w could try to contact the postmaster on
       the wrong port, leading to bogus reports of startup failure.
     * Use "-fwrapv" to defend against possible misoptimization in recent
       gcc versions (Tom)
       This is known to be necessary when building PostgreSQL with gcc 4.3
       or later.
     * Correctly enforce statement_timeout values longer than INT_MAX
       microseconds (about 35 minutes) (Tom)
       This bug affects only builds with "--enable-integer-datetimes".
     * Fix "unexpected PARAM_SUBLINK ID" planner error when
       constant-folding simplifies a sub-select (Tom)
     * Fix logical errors in constraint-exclusion handling of IS NULL and
       NOT expressions (Tom)
       The planner would sometimes exclude partitions that should not have
       been excluded because of the possibility of NULL results.
     * Fix another cause of "failed to build any N-way joins" planner
       errors (Tom)
       This could happen in cases where a clauseless join needed to be
       forced before a join clause could be exploited.
     * Fix incorrect constant propagation in outer-join planning (Tom)
       The planner could sometimes incorrectly conclude that a variable
       could be constrained to be equal to a constant, leading to wrong
       query results.
     * Fix display of constant expressions in ORDER BY and GROUP BY (Tom)
       An explictly casted constant would be shown incorrectly. This could
       for example lead to corruption of a view definition during dump and
       reload.
     * Fix libpq to handle NOTICE messages correctly during COPY OUT (Tom)
       This failure has only been observed to occur when a user-defined
       datatype's output routine issues a NOTICE, but there is no
       guarantee it couldn't happen due to other causes.

                                Release 8.2.6

     Release date: 2008-01-07

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.5, including fixes
   for significant security issues. For information about new features in
   the 8.2 major release, see the Section called Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
       the user running "VACUUM", "ANALYZE", etc (Tom)
       Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates
       are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been
       understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if
       one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that
       triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of
       risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will
       be executed by routine maintenance operations such as "VACUUM
       FULL", which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser
       account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with
       superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition
       and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for
       standard maintenance operations (including "VACUUM", "ANALYZE",
       "REINDEX", and "CLUSTER") to execute as the table owner rather than
       the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism
       already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing
       this security measure, execution of "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" and
       "SET ROLE" is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.
       (CVE-2007-6600)
     * Repair assorted bugs in the regular-expression package (Tom, Will
       Drewry)
       Suitably crafted regular-expression patterns could cause crashes,
       infinite or near-infinite looping, and/or massive memory
       consumption, all of which pose denial-of-service hazards for
       applications that accept regex search patterns from untrustworthy
       sources. (CVE-2007-4769, CVE-2007-4772, CVE-2007-6067)
     * Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
       password authentication, as a security measure (Joe)
       The fix that appeared for this in 8.2.5 was incomplete, as it
       plugged the hole for only some "dblink" functions. (CVE-2007-6601,
       CVE-2007-3278)
     * Fix bugs in WAL replay for GIN indexes (Teodor)
     * Fix GIN index build to work properly when maintenance_work_mem is
       4GB or more (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2007k (in particular,
       recent Argentina changes) (Tom)
     * Improve planner's handling of LIKE/regex estimation in non-C
       locales (Tom)
     * Fix planning-speed problem for deep outer-join nests, as well as
       possible poor choice of join order (Tom)
     * Fix planner failure in some cases of WHERE false AND var IN (SELECT
       ...) (Tom)
     * Make "CREATE TABLE ... SERIAL" and "ALTER SEQUENCE ... OWNED BY"
       not change the currval() state of the sequence (Tom)
     * Preserve the tablespace and storage parameters of indexes that are
       rebuilt by "ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE" (Tom)
     * Make archive recovery always start a new WAL timeline, rather than
       only when a recovery stop time was used (Simon)
       This avoids a corner-case risk of trying to overwrite an existing
       archived copy of the last WAL segment, and seems simpler and
       cleaner than the original definition.
     * Make "VACUUM" not use all of maintenance_work_mem when the table is
       too small for it to be useful (Alvaro)
     * Fix potential crash in translate() when using a multibyte database
       encoding (Tom)
     * Make corr() return the correct result for negative correlation
       values (Neil)
     * Fix overflow in extract(epoch from interval) for intervals
       exceeding 68 years (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Perl to not fail when a UTF-8 regular expression is used in
       a trusted function (Andrew)
     * Fix PL/Perl to cope when platform's Perl defines type bool as int
       rather than char (Tom)
       While this could theoretically happen anywhere, no standard build
       of Perl did things this way ... until Mac OS X 10.5.
     * Fix PL/Python to work correctly with Python 2.5 on 64-bit machines
       (Marko Kreen)
     * Fix PL/Python to not crash on long exception messages (Alvaro)
     * Fix pg_dump to correctly handle inheritance child tables that have
       default expressions different from their parent's (Tom)
     * Fix libpq crash when PGPASSFILE refers to a file that is not a
       plain file (Martin Pitt)
     * ecpg parser fixes (Michael)
     * Make "contrib/pgcrypto" defend against OpenSSL libraries that fail
       on keys longer than 128 bits; which is the case at least on some
       Solaris versions (Marko Kreen)
     * Make "contrib/tablefunc"'s crosstab() handle NULL rowid as a
       category in its own right, rather than crashing (Joe)
     * Fix tsvector and tsquery output routines to escape backslashes
       correctly (Teodor, Bruce)
     * Fix crash of to_tsvector() on huge input strings (Teodor)
     * Require a specific version of Autoconf to be used when
       re-generating the "configure" script (Peter)
       This affects developers and packagers only. The change was made to
       prevent accidental use of untested combinations of Autoconf and
       PostgreSQL versions. You can remove the version check if you really
       want to use a different Autoconf version, but it's your
       responsibility whether the result works or not.
     * Update gettimeofday configuration check so that PostgreSQL can be
       built on newer versions of MinGW (Magnus)

Migration to Version 8.2.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent index corruption when a transaction inserts rows and then
       aborts close to the end of a concurrent "VACUUM" on the same table
       (Tom)
     * Fix ALTER DOMAIN ADD CONSTRAINT for cases involving domains over
       domains (Tom)
     * Make "CREATE DOMAIN ... DEFAULT NULL" work properly (Tom)
     * Fix some planner problems with outer joins, notably poor size
       estimation for t1 LEFT JOIN t2 WHERE t2.col IS NULL (Tom)
     * Allow the interval data type to accept input consisting only of
       milliseconds or microseconds (Neil)
     * Allow timezone name to appear before the year in timestamp input
       (Tom)
     * Fixes for GIN indexes used by "/contrib/tsearch2" (Teodor)
     * Speed up rtree index insertion (Teodor)
     * Fix excessive logging of SSL error messages (Tom)
     * Fix logging so that log messages are never interleaved when using
       the syslogger process (Andrew)
     * Fix crash when log_min_error_statement logging runs out of memory
       (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect handling of some foreign-key corner cases (Tom)

       (Magnus)
     * Suppress timezone name (%Z) in log timestamps on Windows because of
       possible encoding mismatches (Tom)
     * Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
       password authentication, as a security measure (Joe)
     * Restrict "/contrib/pgstattuple" functions to superusers, for
       security reasons (Tom)
     * Do not let "/contrib/intarray" try to make its GIN opclass the
       default (this caused problems at dump/restore) (Tom)

                                Release 8.2.4

     Release date: 2007-04-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.3, including a
   security fix. For information about new features in the 8.2 major
   release, see the Section called Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Support explicit placement of the temporary-table schema within
       search_path, and disable searching it for functions and operators
       (Tom)
       This is needed to allow a security-definer function to set a truly
       secure value of search_path. Without it, an unprivileged SQL user
       can use temporary objects to execute code with the privileges of
       the security-definer function (CVE-2007-2138). See "CREATE
       FUNCTION" for more information.
     * Fix shared_preload_libraries for Windows by forcing reload in each
       backend (Korry Douglas)
     * Fix to_char() so it properly upper/lower cases localized day or
       month names (Pavel Stehule)
     * "/contrib/tsearch2" crash fixes (Teodor)
     * Require "COMMIT PREPARED" to be executed in the same database as
       the transaction was prepared in (Heikki)
     * Allow "pg_dump" to do binary backups larger than two gigabytes on
       Windows (Magnus)
     * New traditional (Taiwan) Chinese FAQ (Zhou Daojing)
     * Prevent the statistics collector from writing to disk too
       frequently (Tom)
     * Fix potential-data-corruption bug in how "VACUUM FULL" handles
       "UPDATE" chains (Tom, Pavan Deolasee)
     * Fix bug in domains that use array types (Tom)
     * Fix "pg_dump" so it can dump a serial column's sequence using "-t"
       when not also dumping the owning table (Tom)
     * Planner fixes, including improving outer join and bitmap scan
       selection logic (Tom)
     * Fix possible wrong answers or crash when a PL/pgSQL function tries
       to RETURN from within an EXCEPTION block (Tom)
     * Fix PANIC during enlargement of a hash index (Tom)
     * Fix POSIX-style timezone specs to follow new USA DST rules (Tom)

                                Release 8.2.3

     Release date: 2007-02-07

   This release contains two fixes from 8.2.2. For information about new
   features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.3

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Remove overly-restrictive check for type length in constraints and
       functional indexes(Tom)
     * Fix optimization so MIN/MAX in subqueries can again use indexes
       (Tom)

                                Release 8.2.2

     Release date: 2007-02-05

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.1, including a
   security fix. For information about new features in the 8.2 major
   release, see the Section called Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Remove security vulnerabilities that allowed connected users to
       read backend memory (Tom)
       The vulnerabilities involve suppressing the normal check that a SQL
       function returns the data type it's declared to, and changing the
       data type of a table column (CVE-2007-0555, CVE-2007-0556). These
       errors can easily be exploited to cause a backend crash, and in
       principle might be used to read database content that the user
       should not be able to access.
     * Fix not-so-rare-anymore bug wherein btree index page splits could
       fail due to choosing an infeasible split point (Heikki Linnakangas)
     * Fix Borland C compile scripts (L Bayuk)
     * Properly handle to_char('CC') for years ending in 00 (Tom)
       Year 2000 is in the twentieth century, not the twenty-first.
     * "/contrib/tsearch2" localization improvements (Tatsuo, Teodor)
     * Fix incorrect permission check in
       information_schema.key_column_usage view (Tom)
       The symptom is "relation with OID nnnnn does not exist" errors. To
       get this fix without using "initdb", use "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW"
       to install the corrected definition found in
       "share/information_schema.sql". Note you will need to do this in
       each database.
     * Improve "VACUUM" performance for databases with many tables (Tom)
     * Fix for rare Assert() crash triggered by UNION (Tom)
     * Fix potentially incorrect results from index searches using ROW
       inequality conditions (Tom)
     * Tighten security of multi-byte character processing for UTF8
       sequences over three bytes long (Tom)
     * Fix bogus "permission denied" failures occurring on Windows due to
       attempts to fsync already-deleted files (Magnus, Tom)
     * Fix bug that could cause the statistics collector to hang on
       Windows (Magnus)
       This would in turn lead to autovacuum not working.
     * Fix possible crashes when an already-in-use PL/pgSQL function is
       updated (Tom)
     * Improve PL/pgSQL handling of domain types (Sergiy Vyshnevetskiy,
       Tom)
     * Fix possible errors in processing PL/pgSQL exception blocks (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.2.1

     Release date: 2007-01-08

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2. For information
   about new features in the 8.2 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2.1

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix crash with SELECT ... LIMIT ALL (also LIMIT NULL) (Tom)
     * "Several /contrib/tsearch2" fixes (Teodor)
     * On Windows, make log messages coming from the operating system use
       ASCII encoding (Hiroshi Saito)
       This fixes a conversion problem when there is a mismatch between
       the encoding of the operating system and database server.
     * Fix Windows linking of pg_dump using "win32.mak" (Hiroshi Saito)
     * Fix planner mistakes for outer join queries (Tom)
     * Fix several problems in queries involving sub-SELECTs (Tom)
     * Fix potential crash in SPI during subtransaction abort (Tom)
       This affects all PL functions since they all use SPI.
     * Improve build speed of PDF documentation (Peter)
     * Re-add JST (Japan) timezone abbreviation (Tom)
     * Improve optimization decisions related to index scans (Tom)
     * Have psql print multi-byte combining characters as before, rather
       than output as \u (Tom)
     * Improve index usage of regular expressions that use parentheses
       (Tom)
       This improves psql \d performance also.
     * Make pg_dumpall assume that databases have public CONNECT
       privilege, when dumping from a pre-8.2 server (Tom)
       This preserves the previous behavior that anyone can connect to a
       database if allowed by "pg_hba.conf".

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.2

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * Set escape_string_warning to on by default (Bruce)
       This issues a warning if backslash escapes are used in non-escape
       (non-E'') strings.
     * Change the row constructor syntax (ROW(...)) so that list elements
       foo.* will be expanded to a list of their member fields, rather
       than creating a nested row type field as formerly (Tom)
       The new behavior is substantially more useful since it allows, for
       example, triggers to check for data changes with IF row(new.*) IS
       DISTINCT FROM row(old.*). The old behavior is still available by
       omitting .*.
     * Make row comparisons follow SQL standard semantics and allow them
       to be used in index scans (Tom)
       Previously, row = and <> comparisons followed the standard but < <=
       > >= did not. A row comparison can now be used as an index
       constraint for a multicolumn index matching the row value.
     * Make row IS [NOT] NULL tests follow SQL standard semantics (Tom)
       The former behavior conformed to the standard for simple cases with
       IS NULL, but IS NOT NULL would return true if any row field was
       non-null, whereas the standard says it should return true only when
       all fields are non-null.
     * Make "SET CONSTRAINT" affect only one constraint (Kris Jurka)
       In previous releases, "SET CONSTRAINT" modified all constraints
       with a matching name. In this release, the schema search path is
       used to modify only the first matching constraint. A schema
       specification is also supported. This more nearly conforms to the
       SQL standard.
     * Remove RULE permission for tables, for security reasons (Tom)
       As of this release, only a table's owner can create or modify rules
       for the table. For backwards compatibility, "GRANT"/"REVOKE RULE"
       is still accepted, but it does nothing.
     * Array comparison improvements (Tom)
       Now array dimensions are also compared.
     * Change array concatenation to match documented behavior (Tom)
       This changes the previous behavior where concatenation would modify
       the array lower bound.
     * Make command-line options of postmaster and postgres identical
       (Peter)
       This allows the postmaster to pass arguments to each backend
       without using -o. Note that some options are now only available as
       long-form options, because there were conflicting single-letter
       options.
     * Deprecate use of postmaster symbolic link (Peter)
       postmaster and postgres commands now act identically, with the
       behavior determined by command-line options. The postmaster
       symbolic link is kept for compatibility, but is not really needed.
     * Change log_duration to output even if the query is not output (Tom)
       In prior releases, log_duration only printed if the query appeared
       earlier in the log.
     * Make to_char(time) and to_char(interval) treat HH and HH12 as
       12-hour intervals
       Most applications should use HH24 unless they want a 12-hour
       display.
     * Zero unmasked bits in conversion from INET to CIDR (Tom)
       This ensures that the converted value is actually valid for CIDR.
     * Remove australian_timezones configuration variable (Joachim
       Wieland)
       This variable has been superseded by a more general facility for
       configuring timezone abbreviations.
     * Improve cost estimation for nested-loop index scans (Tom)
       This might eliminate the need to set unrealistically small values
       of random_page_cost. If you have been using a very small
       random_page_cost, please recheck your test cases.
     * Change behavior of "pg_dump" -n and -t options. (Greg Sabino
       Mullane)
       See the "pg_dump" manual page for details.
     * Change libpq PQdsplen() to return a useful value (Martijn van
       Oosterhout)
     * Declare libpq PQgetssl() as returning void *, rather than SSL *
       (Martijn van Oosterhout)
       This allows applications to use the function without including the
       OpenSSL headers.
     * C-language loadable modules must now include a PG_MODULE_MAGIC
       macro call for version compatibility checking (Martijn van
       Oosterhout)
     * For security's sake, modules used by a PL/PerlU function are no
       longer available to PL/Perl functions (Andrew)

     Note: This also implies that data can no longer be shared between a
     PL/Perl function and a PL/PerlU function. Some Perl installations
     have not been compiled with the correct flags to allow multiple
     interpreters to exist within a single process. In this situation
     PL/Perl and PL/PerlU cannot both be used in a single backend. The
     solution is to get a Perl installation which supports multiple
     interpreters.
     * In "contrib/xml2/", rename xml_valid() to xml_is_well_formed()
       (Tom)
       xml_valid() will remain for backward compatibility, but its
       behavior will change to do schema checking in a future release.
     * Remove "contrib/ora2pg/", now at http://www.samse.fr/GPL/ora2pg
     * Remove contrib modules that have been migrated to PgFoundry:
       "adddepend", "dbase", "dbmirror", "fulltextindex", "mac",
       "userlock"
     * Remove abandoned contrib modules: "mSQL-interface", "tips"
     * Remove QNX and BEOS ports (Bruce)
       These ports no longer had active maintainers.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the changes between
   PostgreSQL 8.2 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance Improvements

     * Allow the planner to reorder outer joins in some circumstances
       (Tom)
       In previous releases, outer joins would always be evaluated in the
       order written in the query. This change allows the query optimizer
       to consider reordering outer joins, in cases where it can determine
       that the join order can be changed without altering the meaning of
       the query. This can make a considerable performance difference for
       queries involving multiple outer joins or mixed inner and outer
       joins.
     * Improve efficiency of IN (list-of-expressions) clauses (Tom)
     * Improve sorting speed and reduce memory usage (Simon, Tom)
     * Improve subtransaction performance (Alvaro, Itagaki Takahiro, Tom)
     * Add FILLFACTOR to table and index creation (ITAGAKI Takahiro)
       This leaves extra free space in each table or index page, allowing
       improved performance as the database grows. This is particularly
       valuable to maintain clustering.
     * Increase default values for shared_buffers and max_fsm_pages
       (Andrew)
     * Improve locking performance by breaking the lock manager tables
       into sections (Tom)
       This allows locking to be more fine-grained, reducing contention.
     * Reduce locking requirements of sequential scans (Qingqing Zhou)
     * Reduce locking required for database creation and destruction (Tom)
     * Improve the optimizer's selectivity estimates for LIKE, ILIKE, and
       regular expression operations (Tom)
     * Improve planning of joins to inherited tables and UNION ALL views
       (Tom)
     * Allow constraint exclusion to be applied to inherited "UPDATE" and
       "DELETE" queries (Tom)
       "SELECT" already honored constraint exclusion.
     * Improve planning of constant WHERE clauses, such as a condition
       that depends only on variables inherited from an outer query level
       (Tom)
     * Protocol-level unnamed prepared statements are re-planned for each
       set of BIND values (Tom)
       This improves performance because the exact parameter values can be
       used in the plan.
     * Speed up vacuuming of B-Tree indexes (Heikki Linnakangas, Tom)
     * Avoid extra scan of tables without indexes during "VACUUM" (Greg
       Stark)
     * Improve multicolumn GiST indexing (Oleg, Teodor)
     * Remove dead index entries before B-Tree page split (Junji Teramoto)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Changes

     * Allow a forced switch to a new transaction log file (Simon, Tom)
       This is valuable for keeping warm standby slave servers in sync
       with the master. Transaction log file switching now also happens
       automatically during pg_stop_backup(). This ensures that all
       transaction log files needed for recovery can be archived
       immediately.
     * Add WAL informational functions (Simon)
       Add functions for interrogating the current transaction log
       insertion point and determining WAL filenames from the hex WAL
       locations displayed by pg_stop_backup() and related functions.
     * Improve recovery from a crash during WAL replay (Simon)
       The server now does periodic checkpoints during WAL recovery, so if
       there is a crash, future WAL recovery is shortened. This also
       eliminates the need for warm standby servers to replay the entire
       log since the base backup if they crash.
     * Improve reliability of long-term WAL replay (Heikki, Simon, Tom)
       Formerly, trying to roll forward through more than 2 billion
       transactions would not work due to XID wraparound. This meant warm
       standby servers had to be reloaded from fresh base backups
       periodically.
     * Add archive_timeout to force transaction log file switches at a
       given interval (Simon)
       This enforces a maximum replication delay for warm standby servers.
     * Add native LDAP authentication (Magnus Hagander)
       This is particularly useful for platforms that do not support PAM,
       such as Windows.
     * Add GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE (Gevik Babakhani)
       This gives SQL-level control over database access. It works as an
       additional filter on top of the existing "pg_hba.conf" controls.
     * Add support for SSL Certificate Revocation List (CRL) files (Libor
       Hohos)
       The server and libpq both recognize CRL files now.
     * GiST indexes are now clusterable (Teodor)
     * Remove routine autovacuum server log entries (Bruce)
       pg_stat_activity now shows autovacuum activity.
     * Track maximum XID age within individual tables, instead of whole
       databases (Alvaro)
       This reduces the overhead involved in preventing transaction ID
       wraparound, by avoiding unnecessary VACUUMs.
     * Add last vacuum and analyze timestamp columns to the stats
       collector (Larry Rosenman)
       These values now appear in the pg_stat_*_tables system views.
     * Improve performance of statistics monitoring, especially
       stats_command_string (Tom, Bruce)
       This release enables stats_command_string by default, now that its
       overhead is minimal. This means pg_stat_activity will now show all
       active queries by default.
     * Add a waiting column to pg_stat_activity (Tom)
       This allows pg_stat_activity to show all the information included
       in the ps display.
     * Add configuration parameter update_process_title to control whether
       the ps display is updated for every command (Bruce)
       On platforms where it is expensive to update the ps display, it
       might be worthwhile to turn this off and rely solely on
       pg_stat_activity for status information.
     * Allow units to be specified in configuration settings (Peter)
       For example, you can now set shared_buffers to 32MB rather than
       mentally converting sizes.
     * Add support for include directives in "postgresql.conf" (Joachim
       Wieland)
     * Improve logging of protocol-level prepare/bind/execute messages
       (Bruce, Tom)
       Such logging now shows statement names, bind parameter values, and
       the text of the query being executed. Also, the query text is
       properly included in logged error messages when enabled by
       log_min_error_statement.
     * Prevent max_stack_depth from being set to unsafe values
       On platforms where we can determine the actual kernel stack depth
       limit (which is most), make sure that the initial default value of
       max_stack_depth is safe, and reject attempts to set it to unsafely
       large values.
     * Enable highlighting of error location in query in more cases (Tom)
       The server is now able to report a specific error location for some
       semantic errors (such as unrecognized column name), rather than
       just for basic syntax errors as before.
     * Fix "failed to re-find parent key" errors in "VACUUM" (Tom)
     * Clean out "pg_internal.init" cache files during server restart
       (Simon)
       This avoids a hazard that the cache files might contain stale data
       after PITR recovery.
     * Fix race condition for truncation of a large relation across a
       gigabyte boundary by "VACUUM" (Tom)
     * Fix bug causing needless deadlock errors on row-level locks (Tom)
     * Fix bugs affecting multi-gigabyte hash indexes (Tom)
     * Each backend process is now its own process group leader (Tom)
       This allows query cancel to abort subprocesses invoked from a
       backend or archive/recovery process.
     __________________________________________________________________

Query Changes

     * Add "INSERT"/"UPDATE"/"DELETE" RETURNING (Jonah Harris, Tom)
       This allows these commands to return values, such as the computed
       serial key for a new row. In the "UPDATE" case, values from the
       updated version of the row are returned.
     * Add support for multiple-row VALUES clauses, per SQL standard (Joe,
       Tom)
       This allows "INSERT" to insert multiple rows of constants, or
       queries to generate result sets using constants. For example,
       INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ...., and SELECT * FROM (VALUES
       (...), (...), ....) AS alias(f1, ...).
     * Allow "UPDATE" and "DELETE" to use an alias for the target table
       (Atsushi Ogawa)
       The SQL standard does not permit an alias in these commands, but
       many database systems allow one anyway for notational convenience.
     * Allow "UPDATE" to set multiple columns with a list of values
       (Susanne Ebrecht)
       This is basically a short-hand for assigning the columns and values
       in pairs. The syntax is UPDATE tab SET (column, ...) = (val, ...).
     * Make row comparisons work per standard (Tom)
       The forms <, <=, >, >= now compare rows lexicographically, that is,
       compare the first elements, if equal compare the second elements,
       and so on. Formerly they expanded to an AND condition across all
       the elements, which was neither standard nor very useful.
     * Add CASCADE option to "TRUNCATE" (Joachim Wieland)
       This causes "TRUNCATE" to automatically include all tables that
       reference the specified table(s) via foreign keys. While
       convenient, this is a dangerous tool -- use with caution!
     * Support FOR UPDATE and FOR SHARE in the same SELECT command (Tom)
     * Add IS NOT DISTINCT FROM (Pavel Stehule)
       This operator is similar to equality (=), but evaluates to true
       when both left and right operands are NULL, and to false when just
       one is, rather than yielding NULL in these cases.
     * Improve the length output used by UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT (Tom)
       When all corresponding columns are of the same defined length, that
       length is used for the result, rather than a generic length.
     * Allow ILIKE to work for multi-byte encodings (Tom)
       Internally, ILIKE now calls lower() and then uses LIKE.
       Locale-specific regular expression patterns still do not work in
       these encodings.
     * Enable standard_conforming_strings to be turned on (Kevin Grittner)
       This allows backslash escaping in strings to be disabled, making
       PostgreSQL more standards-compliant. The default is off for
       backwards compatibility, but future releases will default this to
       on.
     * Do not flatten subqueries that contain volatile functions in their
       target lists (Jaime Casanova)
       This prevents surprising behavior due to multiple evaluation of a
       volatile function (such as random() or nextval()). It might cause
       performance degradation in the presence of functions that are
       unnecessarily marked as volatile.
     * Add system views pg_prepared_statements and pg_cursors to show
       prepared statements and open cursors (Joachim Wieland, Neil)
       These are very useful in pooled connection setups.
     * Support portal parameters in "EXPLAIN" and "EXECUTE" (Tom)
       This allows, for example, JDBC ? parameters to work in these
       commands.
     * If SQL-level "PREPARE" parameters are unspecified, infer their
       types from the content of the query (Neil)
       Protocol-level "PREPARE" already did this.
     * Allow LIMIT and OFFSET to exceed two billion (Dhanaraj M)
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation Changes

     * Add TABLESPACE clause to "CREATE TABLE AS" (Neil)
       This allows a tablespace to be specified for the new table.
     * Add ON COMMIT clause to "CREATE TABLE AS" (Neil)
       This allows temporary tables to be truncated or dropped on
       transaction commit. The default behavior is for the table to remain
       until the session ends.
     * Add INCLUDING CONSTRAINTS to "CREATE TABLE LIKE" (Greg Stark)
       This allows easy copying of CHECK constraints to a new table.
     * Allow the creation of placeholder (shell) types (Martijn van
       Oosterhout)
       A shell type declaration creates a type name, without specifying
       any of the details of the type. Making a shell type is useful
       because it allows cleaner declaration of the type's input/output
       functions, which must exist before the type can be defined "for
       real". The syntax is "CREATE TYPE typename".
     * Aggregate functions now support multiple input parameters (Sergey
       Koposov, Tom)
     * Add new aggregate creation syntax (Tom)
       The new syntax is "CREATE AGGREGATE aggname (input_type)
       (parameter_list)". This more naturally supports the new
       multi-parameter aggregate functionality. The previous syntax is
       still supported.
     * Add "ALTER ROLE PASSWORD NULL" to remove a previously set role
       password (Peter)
     * Add "DROP" object IF EXISTS for many object types (Andrew)
       This allows "DROP" operations on non-existent objects without
       generating an error.
     * Add DROP OWNED to drop all objects owned by a role (Alvaro)
     * Add REASSIGN OWNED to reassign ownership of all objects owned by a
       role (Alvaro)
       This, and DROP OWNED above, facilitate dropping roles.
     * Add "GRANT ON SEQUENCE" syntax (Bruce)
       This was added for setting sequence-specific permissions. GRANT ON
       TABLE for sequences is still supported for backward compatibility.
     * Add USAGE permission for sequences that allows only currval() and
       nextval(), not setval() (Bruce)
       USAGE permission allows more fine-grained control over sequence
       access. Granting USAGE allows users to increment a sequence, but
       prevents them from setting the sequence to an arbitrary value using
       setval().
     * Add ALTER TABLE [ NO ] INHERIT (Greg Stark)
       This allows inheritance to be adjusted dynamically, rather than
       just at table creation and destruction. This is very valuable when
       using inheritance to implement table partitioning.
     * Allow comments on global objects to be stored globally (Kris Jurka)
       Previously, comments attached to databases were stored in
       individual databases, making them ineffective, and there was no
       provision at all for comments on roles or tablespaces. This change
       adds a new shared catalog pg_shdescription and stores comments on
       databases, roles, and tablespaces therein.
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Command Changes

     * Add option to allow indexes to be created without blocking
       concurrent writes to the table (Greg Stark, Tom)
       The new syntax is "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY". The default behavior
       is still to block table modification while a index is being
       created.
     * Provide advisory locking functionality (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tom)
       This is a new locking API designed to replace what used to be in
       /contrib/userlock. The userlock code is now on pgfoundry.
     * Allow "COPY" to dump a "SELECT" query (Zoltan Boszormenyi, Karel
       Zak)
       This allows "COPY" to dump arbitrary SQL queries. The syntax is
       COPY (SELECT ...) TO.
     * Make the "COPY" command return a command tag that includes the
       number of rows copied (Volkan YAZICI)
     * Allow "VACUUM" to expire rows without being affected by other
       concurrent "VACUUM" operations (Hannu Krossing, Alvaro, Tom)
     * Make initdb detect the operating system locale and set the default
       DateStyle accordingly (Peter)
       This makes it more likely that the installed "postgresql.conf"
       DateStyle value will be as desired.
     * Reduce number of progress messages displayed by initdb (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Date/Time Changes

     * Allow full timezone names in timestamp input values (Joachim
       Wieland)
       For example, '2006-05-24 21:11 America/New_York'::timestamptz.
     * Support configurable timezone abbreviations (Joachim Wieland)
       A desired set of timezone abbreviations can be chosen via the
       configuration parameter timezone_abbreviations.
     * Add pg_timezone_abbrevs and pg_timezone_names views to show
       supported timezones (Magnus Hagander)
     * Add clock_timestamp(), statement_timestamp(), and
       transaction_timestamp() (Bruce)
       clock_timestamp() is the current wall-clock time,
       statement_timestamp() is the time the current statement arrived at
       the server, and transaction_timestamp() is an alias for now().
     * Allow to_char() to print localized month and day names (Euler
       Taveira de Oliveira)
     * Allow to_char(time) and to_char(interval) to output AM/PM
       specifications (Bruce)
       Intervals and times are treated as 24-hour periods, e.g. 25 hours
       is considered AM.
     * Add new function justify_interval() to adjust interval units (Mark
       Dilger)
     * Allow timezone offsets up to 14:59 away from GMT
       Kiribati uses GMT+14, so we'd better accept that.
     * Interval computation improvements (Michael Glaesemann, Bruce)
     __________________________________________________________________

Other Data Type and Function Changes

     * Allow arrays to contain NULL elements (Tom)
     * Allow assignment to array elements not contiguous with the existing
       entries (Tom)
       The intervening array positions will be filled with nulls. This is
       per SQL standard.
     * New built-in operators for array-subset comparisons (@>, <@, &&)
       (Teodor, Tom)
       These operators can be indexed for many data types using GiST or
       GIN indexes.
     * Add convenient arithmetic operations on INET/CIDR values (Stephen
       R. van den Berg)
       The new operators are & (and), | (or), ~ (not), inet + int8, inet -
       int8, and inet - inet.
     * Add new aggregate functions from SQL:2003 (Neil)
       The new functions are var_pop(), var_samp(), stddev_pop(), and
       stddev_samp(). var_samp() and stddev_samp() are merely renamings of
       the existing aggregates variance() and stddev(). The latter names
       remain available for backward compatibility.
     * Add SQL:2003 statistical aggregates (Sergey Koposov)
       New functions: regr_intercept(), regr_slope(), regr_r2(), corr(),
       covar_samp(), covar_pop(), regr_avgx(), regr_avgy(), regr_sxy(),
       regr_sxx(), regr_syy(), regr_count().
     * Allow domains to be based on other domains (Tom)
     * Properly enforce domain CHECK constraints everywhere (Neil, Tom)
       For example, the result of a user-defined function that is declared
       to return a domain type is now checked against the domain's
       constraints. This closes a significant hole in the domain
       implementation.
     * Fix problems with dumping renamed SERIAL columns (Tom)
       The fix is to dump a SERIAL column by explicitly specifying its
       DEFAULT and sequence elements, and reconstructing the SERIAL column
       on reload using a new "ALTER SEQUENCE OWNED BY" command. This also
       allows dropping a SERIAL column specification.
     * Add a server-side sleep function pg_sleep() (Joachim Wieland)
     * Add all comparison operators for the tid (tuple id) data type (Mark
       Kirkwood, Greg Stark, Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/PgSQL Server-Side Language Changes

     * Add TG_table_name and TG_table_schema to trigger parameters
       (Andrew)
       TG_relname is now deprecated. Comparable changes have been made in
       the trigger parameters for the other PLs as well.
     * Allow FOR statements to return values to scalars as well as records
       and row types (Pavel Stehule)
     * Add a BY clause to the FOR loop, to control the iteration increment
       (Jaime Casanova)
     * Add STRICT to "SELECT INTO" (Matt Miller)
       STRICT mode throws an exception if more or less than one row is
       returned by the "SELECT", for Oracle PL/SQL compatibility.
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/Perl Server-Side Language Changes

     * Add table_name and table_schema to trigger parameters (Adam
       Sjgren)
     * Add prepared queries (Dmitry Karasik)
     * Make $_TD trigger data a global variable (Andrew)
       Previously, it was lexical, which caused unexpected sharing
       violations.
     * Run PL/Perl and PL/PerlU in separate interpreters, for security
       reasons (Andrew)
       In consequence, they can no longer share data nor loaded modules.
       Also, if Perl has not been compiled with the requisite flags to
       allow multiple interpreters, only one of these languages can be
       used in any given backend process.
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/Python Server-Side Language Changes

     * Named parameters are passed as ordinary variables, as well as in
       the args[] array (Sven Suursoho)
     * Add table_name and table_schema to trigger parameters (Andrew)
     * Allow returning of composite types and result sets (Sven Suursoho)
     * Return result-set as list, iterator, or generator (Sven Suursoho)
     * Allow functions to return void (Neil)
     * Python 2.5 is now supported (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

psql Changes

     * Add new command \password for changing role password with
       client-side password encryption (Peter)
     * Allow \c to connect to a new host and port number (David, Volkan
       YAZICI)
     * Add tablespace display to \l+ (Philip Yarra)
     * Improve \df slash command to include the argument names and modes
       (OUT or INOUT) of the function (David Fetter)
     * Support binary "COPY" (Andreas Pflug)
     * Add option to run the entire session in a single transaction
       (Simon)
       Use option -1 or --single-transaction.
     * Support for automatically retrieving "SELECT" results in batches
       using a cursor (Chris Mair)
       This is enabled using "\set FETCH_COUNT n". This feature allows
       large result sets to be retrieved in psql without attempting to
       buffer the entire result set in memory.
     * Make multi-line values align in the proper column (Martijn van
       Oosterhout)
       Field values containing newlines are now displayed in a more
       readable fashion.
     * Save multi-line statements as a single entry, rather than one line
       at a time (Sergey E. Koposov)
       This makes up-arrow recall of queries easier. (This is not
       available on Windows, because that platform uses the native
       command-line editing present in the operating system.)
     * Make the line counter 64-bit so it can handle files with more than
       two billion lines (David Fetter)
     * Report both the returned data and the command status tag for
       "INSERT"/"UPDATE"/"DELETE RETURNING" (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump Changes

     * Allow complex selection of objects to be included or excluded by
       pg_dump (Greg Sabino Mullane)
       pg_dump now supports multiple -n (schema) and -t (table) options,
       and adds -N and -T options to exclude objects. Also, the arguments
       of these switches can now be wild-card expressions rather than
       single object names, for example -t 'foo*', and a schema can be
       part of a -t or -T switch, for example -t schema1.table1.
     * Add pg_restore --no-data-for-failed-tables option to suppress
       loading data if table creation failed (i.e., the table already
       exists) (Martin Pitt)
     * Add pg_restore option to run the entire session in a single
       transaction (Simon)
       Use option -1 or --single-transaction.
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq Changes

     * Add PQencryptPassword() to encrypt passwords (Tom)
       This allows passwords to be sent pre-encrypted for commands like
       "ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD".
     * Add function PQisthreadsafe() (Bruce)
       This allows applications to query the thread-safety status of the
       library.
     * Add PQdescribePrepared(), PQdescribePortal(), and related functions
       to return information about previously prepared statements and open
       cursors (Volkan YAZICI)
     * Allow LDAP lookups from "pg_service.conf" (Laurenz Albe)
     * Allow a hostname in "~/.pgpass" to match the default socket
       directory (Bruce)
       A blank hostname continues to match any Unix-socket connection, but
       this addition allows entries that are specific to one of several
       postmasters on the machine.
     __________________________________________________________________

ecpg Changes

     * Allow "SHOW" to put its result into a variable (Joachim Wieland)
     * Add "COPY TO STDOUT" (Joachim Wieland)
     * Add regression tests (Joachim Wieland, Michael)
     * Major source code cleanups (Joachim Wieland, Michael)
     __________________________________________________________________

Windows Port

     * Allow MSVC to compile the PostgreSQL server (Magnus, Hiroshi Saito)
     * Add MSVC support for utility commands and pg_dump (Hiroshi Saito)
     * Add support for Windows code pages 1253, 1254, 1255, and 1257 (Kris
       Jurka)
     * Drop privileges on startup, so that the server can be started from
       an administrative account (Magnus)
     * Stability fixes (Qingqing Zhou, Magnus)
     * Add native semaphore implementation (Qingqing Zhou)
       The previous code mimicked SysV semaphores.
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code Changes

     * Add GIN (Generalized Inverted iNdex) index access method (Teodor,
       Oleg)
     * Remove R-tree indexing (Tom)
       Rtree has been re-implemented using GiST. Among other differences,
       this means that rtree indexes now have support for crash recovery
       via write-ahead logging (WAL).
     * Reduce libraries needlessly linked into the backend (Martijn van
       Oosterhout, Tom)
     * Add a configure flag to allow libedit to be preferred over GNU
       readline (Bruce)
       Use configure --with-libedit-preferred.
     * Allow installation into directories containing spaces (Peter)
     * Improve ability to relocate installation directories (Tom)
     * Add support for Solaris x86_64 using the Solaris compiler (Pierre
       Girard, Theo Schlossnagle, Bruce)
     * Add DTrace support (Robert Lor)
     * Add PG_VERSION_NUM for use by third-party applications wanting to
       test the backend version in C using > and < comparisons (Bruce)
     * Add XLOG_BLCKSZ as independent from BLCKSZ (Mark Wong)
     * Add LWLOCK_STATS define to report locking activity (Tom)
     * Emit warnings for unknown configure options (Martijn van
       Oosterhout)
     * Add server support for "plugin" libraries that can be used for
       add-on tasks such as debugging and performance measurement (Korry
       Douglas)
       This consists of two features: a table of "rendezvous variables"
       that allows separately-loaded shared libraries to communicate, and
       a new configuration parameter local_preload_libraries that allows
       libraries to be loaded into specific sessions without explicit
       cooperation from the client application. This allows external
       add-ons to implement features such as a PL/PgSQL debugger.
     * Rename existing configuration parameter preload_libraries to
       shared_preload_libraries (Tom)
       This was done for clarity in comparison to local_preload_libraries.
     * Add new configuration parameter server_version_num (Greg Sabino
       Mullane)
       This is like server_version, but is an integer, e.g. 80200. This
       allows applications to make version checks more easily.
     * Add a configuration parameter seq_page_cost (Tom)
     * Re-implement the regression test script as a C program (Magnus,
       Tom)
     * Allow loadable modules to allocate shared memory and lightweight
       locks (Marc Munro)
     * Add automatic initialization and finalization of dynamically loaded
       libraries (Ralf Engelschall, Tom)
       New functions _PG_init() and _PG_fini() are called if the library
       defines such symbols. Hence we no longer need to specify an
       initialization function in shared_preload_libraries; we can assume
       that the library used the _PG_init() convention instead.
     * Add PG_MODULE_MAGIC header block to all shared object files
       (Martijn van Oosterhout)
       The magic block prevents version mismatches between loadable object
       files and servers.
     * Add shared library support for AIX (Laurenz Albe)
     * New XML documentation section (Bruce)
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib Changes

     * Major tsearch2 improvements (Oleg, Teodor)
          + multibyte encoding support, including UTF8
          + query rewriting support
          + improved ranking functions
          + thesaurus dictionary support
          + Ispell dictionaries now recognize MySpell format, used by
            OpenOffice
          + GIN support
     * Add adminpack module containing Pgadmin administration functions
       (Dave)
       These functions provide additional file system access routines not
       present in the default PostgreSQL server.
     * Add sslinfo module (Victor Wagner)
       Reports information about the current connection's SSL certificate.
     * Add pgrowlocks module (Tatsuo)
       This shows row locking information for a specified table.
     * Add hstore module (Oleg, Teodor)
     * Add isn module, replacing isbn_issn (Jeremy Kronuz)
       This new implementation supports EAN13, UPC, ISBN (books), ISMN
       (music), and ISSN (serials).
     * Add index information functions to pgstattuple (ITAGAKI Takahiro,
       Satoshi Nagayasu)
     * Add pg_freespacemap module to display free space map information
       (Mark Kirkwood)
     * pgcrypto now has all planned functionality (Marko Kreen)
          + Include iMath library in pgcrypto to have the public-key
            encryption functions always available.
          + Add SHA224 algorithm that was missing in OpenBSD code.
          + Activate builtin code for SHA224/256/384/512 hashes on older
            OpenSSL to have those algorithms always available.
          + New function gen_random_bytes() that returns cryptographically
            strong randomness. Useful for generating encryption keys.
          + Remove digest_exists(), hmac_exists() and cipher_exists()
            functions.
     * Improvements to cube module (Joshua Reich)
       New functions are cube(float[]), cube(float[], float[]), and
       cube_subset(cube, int4[]).
     * Add async query capability to dblink (Kai Londenberg, Joe Conway)
     * New operators for array-subset comparisons (@>, <@, &&) (Tom)
       Various contrib packages already had these operators for their
       datatypes, but the naming wasn't consistent. We have now added
       consistently named array-subset comparison operators to the core
       code and all the contrib packages that have such functionality.
       (The old names remain available, but are deprecated.)
     * Add uninstall scripts for all contrib packages that have install
       scripts (David, Josh Drake)

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
       changing session-local state (Gurjeet Singh, Tom)
       This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions from
       possibly subverting a superuser's session (CVE-2009-4136).
     * Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
       common name (CN) field (Magnus)
       This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a server or
       client name during SSL validation (CVE-2009-4034).
     * Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization
       (Tom)
     * Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)
       This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's
       already committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
       if a plain VACUUM is interrupted after having truncated the table.
     * Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
       calculation (Tom)
       This could occur with extremely large planner estimates for the
       size of a hashjoin's result.
     * Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons (Chris Mikkelson)
     * Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared transactions
       are not ignored (Heikki)
     * Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
       accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
     * Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)
       The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
       Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
       domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
       was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
       stack would pass to it.
     * Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
       FUNCTION (Tom)
     * Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL arrays
       when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function (Andrew Dunstan,
       Abhijit Menon-Sen)
       This worked correctly already for non-set-returning functions.
     * Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python (Peter)
     * Ensure psql's flex module is compiled with the correct system
       header definitions (Tom)
       This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile
       causes incompatible changes in the generated code.
     * Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
       connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
       libpq versions (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
       changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji, Novokuznetsk,
       Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also historical corrections for
       Hong Kong.

                               Release 8.1.18

     Release date: 2009-09-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.17. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.18

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   have any hash indexes on interval columns, you must "REINDEX" them
   after updating to 8.1.18. Also, if you are upgrading from a version
   earlier than 8.1.15, see the release notes for 8.1.15.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)
       This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch that
       disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions. (See CVE-2007-6600)
     * Fix handling of sub-SELECTs appearing in the arguments of an
       outer-level aggregate function (Tom)
     * Fix hash calculation for data type interval (Tom)
       This corrects wrong results for hash joins on interval values. It
       also changes the contents of hash indexes on interval columns. If
       you have any such indexes, you must "REINDEX" them after updating.
     * Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
       'HH'/'HH12' (Heikki)
       It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
     * Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
       and integer datetimes are in use (Alex Hunsaker)
     * Fix calculation of distance between a point and a line segment
       (Tom)
       This led to incorrect results from a number of geometric operators.
     * Fix money data type to work in locales where currency amounts have
       no fractional digits, e.g. Japan (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Properly round datetime input like
       00:12:57.9999999999999999999999999999 (Tom)
     * Fix poor choice of page split point in GiST R-tree operator classes
       (Teodor)
     * Fix portability issues in plperl initialization (Andrew Dunstan)
     * Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
       empty (Jeff Davis)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
       number of parameters (twenty) (Tom)
     * Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
       "COPY FROM STDIN" (Tom)
     * Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
       both libraries are installed (Zdenek Kotala)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009l for DST law
       changes in Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Argentina/San_Luis,
       Cuba, Jordan (historical correction only), Mauritius, Morocco,
       Palestine, Syria, Tunisia.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.1.17

     Release date: 2009-03-16

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.16. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.17

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.15, see the release notes
   for 8.1.15.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails
       (Tom)
       This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
       related failure scenarios. The previous fixes were narrowly
       tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now
       recognized that *any* error thrown by an encoding conversion
       function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying
       to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable
       translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form
       of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive
       error reporting situation. (CVE-2009-0922)
     * Disallow "CREATE CONVERSION" with the wrong encodings for the
       specified conversion function (Heikki)
       This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion
       failure. The previous change is a backstop to guard against other
       kinds of failures in the same area.
     * Fix core dump when to_char() is given format codes that are
       inappropriate for the type of the data argument (Tom)
     * Fix decompilation of CASE WHEN with an implicit coercion (Tom)
       This mistake could lead to Assert failures in an Assert-enabled
       build, or an "unexpected CASE WHEN clause" error message in other
       cases, when trying to examine or dump a view.
     * Fix possible misassignment of the owner of a TOAST table's rowtype
       (Tom)
       If "CLUSTER" or a rewriting variant of "ALTER TABLE" were executed
       by someone other than the table owner, the pg_type entry for the
       table's TOAST table would end up marked as owned by that someone.
       This caused no immediate problems, since the permissions on the
       TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any ordinary database operation.
       However, it could lead to unexpected failures if one later tried to
       drop the role that issued the command (in 8.1 or 8.2), or "owner of
       data type appears to be invalid" warnings from pg_dump after having
       done so (in 8.3).
     * Clean up PL/pgSQL error status variables fully at block exit
       (Ashesh Vashi and Dave Page)
       This is not a problem for PL/pgSQL itself, but the omission could
       cause the PL/pgSQL Debugger to crash while examining the state of a
       function.
     * Add MUST (Mauritius Island Summer Time) to the default list of
       known timezone abbreviations (Xavier Bugaud)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.1.16

     Release date: 2009-02-02

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.15. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.16

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.15, see the release notes
   for 8.1.15.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix crash in autovacuum (Alvaro)
       The crash occurs only after vacuuming a whole database for
       anti-transaction-wraparound purposes, which means that it occurs
       infrequently and is hard to track down.
     * Improve handling of URLs in headline() function (Teodor)
     * Improve handling of overlength headlines in headline() function
       (Teodor)
     * Prevent possible Assert failure or misconversion if an encoding
       conversion is created with the wrong conversion function for the
       specified pair of encodings (Tom, Heikki)
     * Avoid unnecessary locking of small tables in "VACUUM" (Heikki)
     * Ensure that the contents of a holdable cursor don't depend on the
       contents of TOAST tables (Tom)
       Previously, large field values in a cursor result might be
       represented as TOAST pointers, which would fail if the referenced
       table got dropped before the cursor is read, or if the large value
       is deleted and then vacuumed away. This cannot happen with an
       ordinary cursor, but it could with a cursor that is held past its
       creating transaction.
     * Fix uninitialized variables in "contrib/tsearch2"'s get_covers()
       function (Teodor)
     * Fix configure script to properly report failure when unable to
       obtain linkage information for PL/Perl (Andrew)
     * Make all documentation reference pgsql-bugs and/or pgsql-hackers as
       appropriate, instead of the now-decommissioned pgsql-ports and
       pgsql-patches mailing lists (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009a (for Kathmandu
       and historical DST corrections in Switzerland, Cuba)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.1.15

     Release date: 2008-11-03

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.14. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.15

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2. Also, if you were running a previous 8.1.X release, it is
   recommended to "REINDEX" all GiST indexes after the upgrade.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix GiST index corruption due to marking the wrong index entry
       "dead" after a deletion (Teodor)
       This would result in index searches failing to find rows they
       should have found. Corrupted indexes can be fixed with "REINDEX".
     * Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a
       localized error message (Tom)
       We have addressed similar issues before, but it would still fail if
       the "character has no equivalent" message itself couldn't be
       converted. The fix is to disable localization and send the plain
       ASCII error message when we detect such a situation.
     * Fix possible crash when deeply nested functions are invoked from a
       trigger (Tom)
     * Fix mis-expansion of rule queries when a sub-SELECT appears in a
       function call in FROM, a multi-row VALUES list, or a RETURNING list
       (Tom)
       The usual symptom of this problem is an "unrecognized node type"
       error.
     * Ensure an error is reported when a newly-defined PL/pgSQL trigger
       function is invoked as a normal function (Tom)
     * Prevent possible collision of relfilenode numbers when moving a
       table to another tablespace with "ALTER SET TABLESPACE" (Heikki)
       The command tried to re-use the existing filename, instead of
       picking one that is known unused in the destination directory.
     * Fix incorrect tsearch2 headline generation when single query item
       matches first word of text (Sushant Sinha)
     * Fix improper display of fractional seconds in interval values when
       using a non-ISO datestyle in an "--enable-integer-datetimes" build
       (Ron Mayer)
     * Ensure SPI_getvalue and SPI_getbinval behave correctly when the
       passed tuple and tuple descriptor have different numbers of columns
       (Tom)
       This situation is normal when a table has had columns added or
       removed, but these two functions didn't handle it properly. The
       only likely consequence is an incorrect error indication.
     * Fix ecpg's parsing of "CREATE ROLE" (Michael)
     * Fix recent breakage of pg_ctl restart (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008i (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Brazil, Mauritius, Syria)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.1.14

     Release date: 2008-09-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.13. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.14

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Widen local lock counters from 32 to 64 bits (Tom)
       This responds to reports that the counters could overflow in
       sufficiently long transactions, leading to unexpected "lock is
       already held" errors.
     * Fix possible duplicate output of tuples during a GiST index scan
       (Teodor)
     * Add checks in executor startup to ensure that the tuples produced
       by an "INSERT" or "UPDATE" will match the target table's current
       rowtype (Tom)
       "ALTER COLUMN TYPE", followed by re-use of a previously cached
       plan, could produce this type of situation. The check protects
       against data corruption and/or crashes that could ensue.
     * Fix AT TIME ZONE to first try to interpret its timezone argument as
       a timezone abbreviation, and only try it as a full timezone name if
       that fails, rather than the other way around as formerly (Tom)
       The timestamp input functions have always resolved ambiguous zone
       names in this order. Making AT TIME ZONE do so as well improves
       consistency, and fixes a compatibility bug introduced in 8.1: in
       ambiguous cases we now behave the same as 8.0 and before did, since
       in the older versions AT TIME ZONE accepted *only* abbreviations.
     * Fix datetime input functions to correctly detect integer overflow
       when running on a 64-bit platform (Tom)
     * Improve performance of writing very long log messages to syslog
       (Tom)
     * Fix bug in backwards scanning of a cursor on a SELECT DISTINCT ON
       query (Tom)
     * Fix planner bug with nested sub-select expressions (Tom)
       If the outer sub-select has no direct dependency on the parent
       query, but the inner one does, the outer value might not get
       recalculated for new parent query rows.
     * Fix planner to estimate that GROUP BY expressions yielding boolean
       results always result in two groups, regardless of the expressions'
       contents (Tom)
       This is very substantially more accurate than the regular GROUP BY
       estimate for certain boolean tests like "col" IS NULL.
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to not fail when a FOR loop's target variable is a
       record containing composite-type fields (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Tcl to behave correctly with Tcl 8.5, and to be more careful
       about the encoding of data sent to or from Tcl (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Python to work with Python 2.5
       This is a back-port of fixes made during the 8.2 development cycle.
     * Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's error reporting after failure to
       send a SQL command (Tom)
     * Fix pg_ctl to properly preserve postmaster command-line arguments
       across a restart (Bruce)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008f (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Mauritius, Morocco,
       Pakistan, Palestine, and Paraguay)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.1.13

     Release date: 2008-06-12

   This release contains one serious and one minor bug fix over 8.1.12.
   For information about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the
   Section called Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.13

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Make pg_get_ruledef() parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
       Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be
       dumped as, say, -42::integer, which is subtly incorrect: it should
       be (-42)::integer due to operator precedence rules. Usually this
       would make little difference, but it could interact with another
       recent patch to cause PostgreSQL to reject what had been a valid
       "SELECT DISTINCT" view query. Since this could result in pg_dump
       output failing to reload, it is being treated as a high-priority
       fix. The only released versions in which dump output is actually
       incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.
     * Make "ALTER AGGREGATE ... OWNER TO" update pg_shdepend (Tom)
       This oversight could lead to problems if the aggregate was later
       involved in a "DROP OWNED" or "REASSIGN OWNED" operation.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.1.12

     Release date: never released

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.11. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.12

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ... PRIMARY KEY" so that the new column
       is correctly checked to see if it's been initialized to all
       non-nulls (Brendan Jurd)
       Previous versions neglected to check this requirement at all.
     * Fix possible "CREATE TABLE" failure when inheriting the "same"
       constraint from multiple parent relations that inherited that
       constraint from a common ancestor (Tom)
     * Fix conversions between ISO-8859-5 and other encodings to handle
       Cyrillic "Yo" characters (e and E with two dots) (Sergey Burladyan)
     * Fix a few datatype input functions that were allowing unused bytes
       in their results to contain uninitialized, unpredictable values
       (Tom)
       This could lead to failures in which two apparently identical
       literal values were not seen as equal, resulting in the parser
       complaining about unmatched ORDER BY and DISTINCT expressions.
     * Fix a corner case in regular-expression substring matching
       (substring(string from pattern)) (Tom)
       The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
       the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
       subexpression hasn't got a match. An example is substring('foo'
       from 'foo(bar)?'). This should return NULL, since (bar) isn't
       matched, but it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match
       instead (ie, foo).
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008c (for DST law
       changes in Morocco, Iraq, Choibalsan, Pakistan, Syria, Cuba,
       Argentina/San_Luis, and Chile)
     * Fix incorrect result from ecpg's PGTYPEStimestamp_sub() function
       (Michael)
     * Fix core dump in "contrib/xml2"'s xpath_table() function when the
       input query returns a NULL value (Tom)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s makefile to not override CFLAGS (Tom)
     * Fix DatumGetBool macro to not fail with gcc 4.3 (Tom)
       This problem affects "old style" (V0) C functions that return
       boolean. The fix is already in 8.3, but the need to back-patch it
       was not realized at the time.
     * Fix longstanding "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" race condition (Tom)
       In rare cases a session that had just executed a "LISTEN" might not
       get a notification, even though one would be expected because the
       concurrent transaction executing "NOTIFY" was observed to commit
       later.
       A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed a
       not-yet-committed "LISTEN" command will not see any row in
       pg_listener for the "LISTEN", should it choose to look; formerly it
       would have. This behavior was never documented one way or the
       other, but it is possible that some applications depend on the old
       behavior.
     * Disallow "LISTEN" and "UNLISTEN" within a prepared transaction
       (Tom)
       This was formerly allowed but trying to do it had various
       unpleasant consequences, notably that the originating backend could
       not exit as long as an "UNLISTEN" remained uncommitted.
     * Fix rare crash when an error occurs during a query using a hash
       index (Heikki)
     * Fix input of datetime values for February 29 in years BC (Tom)
       The former coding was mistaken about which years were leap years.
     * Fix "unrecognized node type" error in some variants of "ALTER
       OWNER" (Tom)
     * Fix pg_ctl to correctly extract the postmaster's port number from
       command-line options (Itagaki Takahiro, Tom)
       Previously, pg_ctl start -w could try to contact the postmaster on
       the wrong port, leading to bogus reports of startup failure.
     * Use "-fwrapv" to defend against possible misoptimization in recent
       gcc versions (Tom)
       This is known to be necessary when building PostgreSQL with gcc 4.3
       or later.
     * Fix display of constant expressions in ORDER BY and GROUP BY (Tom)
       An explictly casted constant would be shown incorrectly. This could
       for example lead to corruption of a view definition during dump and
       reload.
     * Fix libpq to handle NOTICE messages correctly during COPY OUT (Tom)
       This failure has only been observed to occur when a user-defined
       datatype's output routine issues a NOTICE, but there is no
       guarantee it couldn't happen due to other causes.

                               Release 8.1.11

     Release date: 2008-01-07

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.10, including fixes
   for significant security issues. For information about new features in
   the 8.1 major release, see the Section called Release 8.1.

   This is the last 8.1.X release for which the PostgreSQL community will
   produce binary packages for Windows. Windows users are encouraged to
   move to 8.2.X or later, since there are Windows-specific fixes in 8.2.X
   that are impractical to back-port. 8.1.X will continue to be supported
   on other platforms.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.11

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
       the user running "VACUUM", "ANALYZE", etc (Tom)
       Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates
       are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been
       understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if
       one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that
       triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of
       risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will
       be executed by routine maintenance operations such as "VACUUM
       FULL", which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser
       account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with
       superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition
       and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for
       standard maintenance operations (including "VACUUM", "ANALYZE",
       "REINDEX", and "CLUSTER") to execute as the table owner rather than
       the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism
       already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing
       this security measure, execution of "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" and
       "SET ROLE" is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.
       (CVE-2007-6600)
     * Repair assorted bugs in the regular-expression package (Tom, Will
       Drewry)
       Suitably crafted regular-expression patterns could cause crashes,
       infinite or near-infinite looping, and/or massive memory
       consumption, all of which pose denial-of-service hazards for
       applications that accept regex search patterns from untrustworthy
       sources. (CVE-2007-4769, CVE-2007-4772, CVE-2007-6067)
     * Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
       password authentication, as a security measure (Joe)
       The fix that appeared for this in 8.1.10 was incomplete, as it
       plugged the hole for only some "dblink" functions. (CVE-2007-6601,
       CVE-2007-3278)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2007k (in particular,
       recent Argentina changes) (Tom)
     * Improve planner's handling of LIKE/regex estimation in non-C
       locales (Tom)
     * Fix planner failure in some cases of WHERE false AND var IN (SELECT
       ...) (Tom)
     * Preserve the tablespace of indexes that are rebuilt by "ALTER TABLE
       ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE" (Tom)
     * Make archive recovery always start a new WAL timeline, rather than
       only when a recovery stop time was used (Simon)
       This avoids a corner-case risk of trying to overwrite an existing
       archived copy of the last WAL segment, and seems simpler and
       cleaner than the original definition.
     * Make "VACUUM" not use all of maintenance_work_mem when the table is
       too small for it to be useful (Alvaro)
     * Fix potential crash in translate() when using a multibyte database
       encoding (Tom)
     * Fix overflow in extract(epoch from interval) for intervals
       exceeding 68 years (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Perl to not fail when a UTF-8 regular expression is used in
       a trusted function (Andrew)
     * Fix PL/Perl to cope when platform's Perl defines type bool as int
       rather than char (Tom)
       While this could theoretically happen anywhere, no standard build
       of Perl did things this way ... until Mac OS X 10.5.
     * Fix PL/Python to not crash on long exception messages (Alvaro)
     * Fix pg_dump to correctly handle inheritance child tables that have
       default expressions different from their parent's (Tom)
     * Fix libpq crash when PGPASSFILE refers to a file that is not a
       plain file (Martin Pitt)
     * ecpg parser fixes (Michael)
     * Make "contrib/pgcrypto" defend against OpenSSL libraries that fail
       on keys longer than 128 bits; which is the case at least on some
       Solaris versions (Marko Kreen)
     * Make "contrib/tablefunc"'s crosstab() handle NULL rowid as a
       category in its own right, rather than crashing (Joe)
     * Fix tsvector and tsquery output routines to escape backslashes
       correctly (Teodor, Bruce)
     * Fix crash of to_tsvector() on huge input strings (Teodor)
     * Require a specific version of Autoconf to be used when
       re-generating the "configure" script (Peter)
       This affects developers and packagers only. The change was made to
       prevent accidental use of untested combinations of Autoconf and
       PostgreSQL versions. You can remove the version check if you really
       want to use a different Autoconf version, but it's your
       responsibility whether the result works or not.

                                Release 8.1.9

     Release date: 2007-04-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.8, including a
   security fix. For information about new features in the 8.1 major
   release, see the Section called Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.9

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Support explicit placement of the temporary-table schema within
       search_path, and disable searching it for functions and operators
       (Tom)
       This is needed to allow a security-definer function to set a truly
       secure value of search_path. Without it, an unprivileged SQL user
       can use temporary objects to execute code with the privileges of
       the security-definer function (CVE-2007-2138). See "CREATE
       FUNCTION" for more information.
     * "/contrib/tsearch2" crash fixes (Teodor)
     * Require "COMMIT PREPARED" to be executed in the same database as
       the transaction was prepared in (Heikki)
     * Fix potential-data-corruption bug in how "VACUUM FULL" handles
       "UPDATE" chains (Tom, Pavan Deolasee)
     * Planner fixes, including improving outer join and bitmap scan
       selection logic (Tom)
     * Fix PANIC during enlargement of a hash index (bug introduced in
       8.1.6) (Tom)
     * Fix POSIX-style timezone specs to follow new USA DST rules (Tom)

                                Release 8.1.8

     Release date: 2007-02-07

   This release contains one fix from 8.1.7. For information about new
   features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you

       functional indexes(Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.7

     Release date: 2007-02-05

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.6, including a
   security fix. For information about new features in the 8.1 major
   release, see the Section called Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Remove security vulnerabilities that allowed connected users to
       read backend memory (Tom)
       The vulnerabilities involve suppressing the normal check that a SQL
       function returns the data type it's declared to, and changing the
       data type of a table column (CVE-2007-0555, CVE-2007-0556). These
       errors can easily be exploited to cause a backend crash, and in
       principle might be used to read database content that the user
       should not be able to access.
     * Fix rare bug wherein btree index page splits could fail due to
       choosing an infeasible split point (Heikki Linnakangas)
     * Improve "VACUUM" performance for databases with many tables (Tom)
     * Fix autovacuum to avoid leaving non-permanent transaction IDs in
       non-connectable databases (Alvaro)
       This bug affects the 8.1 branch only.
     * Fix for rare Assert() crash triggered by UNION (Tom)
     * Tighten security of multi-byte character processing for UTF8
       sequences over three bytes long (Tom)
     * Fix bogus "permission denied" failures occurring on Windows due to
       attempts to fsync already-deleted files (Magnus, Tom)
     * Fix possible crashes when an already-in-use PL/pgSQL function is
       updated (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.6

     Release date: 2007-01-08

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.5. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Improve handling of getaddrinfo() on AIX (Tom)
       This fixes a problem with starting the statistics collector, among
       other things.
     * Fix pg_restore to handle a tar-format backup that contains large
       objects (blobs) with comments (Tom)
     * Fix "failed to re-find parent key" errors in "VACUUM" (Tom)
     * Clean out "pg_internal.init" cache files during server restart
       (Simon)
       This avoids a hazard that the cache files might contain stale data
       after PITR recovery.
     * Fix race condition for truncation of a large relation across a
       gigabyte boundary by "VACUUM" (Tom)
     * Fix bug causing needless deadlock errors on row-level locks (Tom)
     * Fix bugs affecting multi-gigabyte hash indexes (Tom)
     * Fix possible deadlock in Windows signal handling (Teodor)
     * Fix error when constructing an ARRAY[] made up of multiple empty
       elements (Tom)
     * Fix ecpg memory leak during connection (Michael)
     * Fix for Darwin (OS X) compilation (Tom)
     * to_number() and to_char(numeric) are now STABLE, not IMMUTABLE, for
       new initdb installs (Tom)
       This is because lc_numeric can potentially change the output of
       these functions.
     * Improve index usage of regular expressions that use parentheses
       (Tom)
       This improves psql \d performance also.
     * Update timezone database
       This affects Australian and Canadian daylight-savings rules in
       particular.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.5

     Release date: 2006-10-16

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.4. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow aggregate functions in "UPDATE" commands, except within
       sub-SELECTs (Tom)
       The behavior of such an aggregate was unpredictable, and in 8.1.X
       could cause a crash, so it has been disabled. The SQL standard does
       not allow this either.
     * Fix core dump when an untyped literal is taken as ANYARRAY
     * Fix core dump in duration logging for extended query protocol when
       a "COMMIT" or "ROLLBACK" is executed
     * Fix mishandling of AFTER triggers when query contains a SQL
       function returning multiple rows (Tom)
     * Fix "ALTER TABLE ... TYPE" to recheck NOT NULL for USING clause
       (Tom)
     * Fix string_to_array() to handle overlapping matches for the
       separator string
       For example, string_to_array('123xx456xxx789', 'xx').
     * Fix to_timestamp() for AM/PM formats (Bruce)
     * Fix autovacuum's calculation that decides whether "ANALYZE" is
       needed (Alvaro)
     * Fix corner cases in pattern matching for psql's \d commands
     * Fix index-corrupting bugs in /contrib/ltree (Teodor)
     * Numerous robustness fixes in ecpg (Joachim Wieland)
     * Fix backslash escaping in /contrib/dbmirror
     * Minor fixes in /contrib/dblink and /contrib/tsearch2
     * Efficiency improvements in hash tables and bitmap index scans (Tom)
     * Fix instability of statistics collection on Windows (Tom, Andrew)
     * Fix statement_timeout to use the proper units on Win32 (Bruce)
       In previous Win32 8.1.X versions, the delay was off by a factor of
       100.
     * Fixes for MSVC and Borland C++ compilers (Hiroshi Saito)
     * Fixes for AIX and Intel compilers (Tom)
     * Fix rare bug in continuous archiving (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.4

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.3, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues. For information about new
   features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 might require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       might require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote
       is in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations and standard_conforming_strings
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also
       future-proofs them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard
       string literal syntax. Applications that use multiple PostgreSQL
       connections concurrently should migrate to PQescapeStringConn() and
       PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that escaping is done correctly for
       the settings in use in each database connection. Applications that
       do string escaping "by hand" should be modified to rely on library
       routines instead.
     * Fix weak key selection in pgcrypto (Marko Kreen)
       Errors in fortuna PRNG reseeding logic could cause a predictable
       session key to be selected by pgp_sym_encrypt() in some cases. This
       only affects non-OpenSSL-using builds.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, win866_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Make autovacuum visible in pg_stat_activity (Alvaro)
     * Disable full_page_writes (Tom)
       In certain cases, having full_page_writes off would cause crash
       recovery to fail. A proper fix will appear in 8.2; for now it's
       just disabled.
     * Various planner fixes, particularly for bitmap index scans and
       MIN/MAX optimization (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect optimization in merge join (Tom)
       Outer joins could sometimes emit multiple copies of unmatched rows.
     * Fix crash from using and modifying a plpgsql function in the same
       transaction
     * Fix WAL replay for case where a B-Tree index has been truncated
     * Fix SIMILAR TO for patterns involving | (Tom)
     * Fix "SELECT INTO" and "CREATE TABLE AS" to create tables in the
       default tablespace, not the base directory (Kris Jurka)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Improve qsort performance (Dann Corbit)
       Currently this code is only used on Solaris.
     * Fix for OS/X Bonjour on x86 systems (Ashley Clark)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks
     * Fix problem with password prompting on some Win32 systems (Robert
       Kinberg)
     * Improve pg_dump's handling of default values for domains
     * Fix pg_dumpall to handle identically-named users and groups
       reasonably (only possible when dumping from a pre-8.1 server) (Tom)
       The user and group will be merged into a single role with LOGIN
       permission. Formerly the merged role wouldn't have LOGIN
       permission, making it unusable as a user.
     * Fix pg_restore -n to work as documented (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.3

     Release date: 2006-02-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.2, including one very
   serious security issue. For information about new features in the 8.1
   major release, see the Section called Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.3

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix bug that allowed any logged-in user to "SET ROLE" to any other
       database user id (CVE-2006-0553)
       Due to inadequate validity checking, a user could exploit the
       special case that "SET ROLE" normally uses to restore the previous
       role setting after an error. This allowed ordinary users to acquire
       superuser status, for example. The escalation-of-privilege risk
       exists only in 8.1.0-8.1.2. However, in all releases back to 7.3
       there is a related bug in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" that allows
       unprivileged users to crash the server, if it has been compiled
       with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to Akio
       Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 8.0.4, 7.4.9, and 7.3.11 releases.
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog and pg_subtrans file creation (Tom)
     * Fix cases that could lead to crashes if a cache-invalidation
       message arrives at just the wrong time (Tom)
     * Properly check DOMAIN constraints for UNKNOWN parameters in
       prepared statements (Neil)
     * Ensure "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" will process FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and
       PRIMARY KEY constraints in the proper order (Nakano Yoshihisa)
     * Fixes to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators or operator classes (Tom)
     * Allow pg_restore to continue properly after a "COPY" failure;
       formerly it tried to treat the remaining "COPY" data as SQL
       commands (Stephen Frost)
     * Fix pg_ctl unregister crash when the data directory is not
       specified (Magnus)
     * Fix libpq PQprint HTML tags (Christoph Zwerschke)
     * Fix ecpg crash on AMD64 and PPC (Neil)
     * Allow SETOF and %TYPE to be used together in function result type
       declarations
     * Recover properly if error occurs during argument passing in
       PL/python (Neil)
     * Fix memory leak in plperl_return_next (Neil)
     * Fix PL/perl's handling of locales on Win32 to match the backend
       (Andrew)
     * Various optimizer fixes (Tom)
     * Fix crash when log_min_messages is set to DEBUG3 or above in
       "postgresql.conf" on Win32 (Bruce)
     * Fix pgxs -L library path specification for Win32, Cygwin, OS X, AIX
       (Bruce)
     * Check that SID is enabled while checking for Win32 admin privileges
       (Magnus)
     * Properly reject out-of-range date inputs (Kris Jurka)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)
     * Improve speed of "COPY IN" via libpq, by avoiding a kernel call per
       data line (Alon Goldshuv)
     * Improve speed of "/contrib/tsearch2" index creation (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.2

     Release date: 2006-01-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.1. For information
   about new features in the 8.1 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, you
   might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns after updating, if
   you are affected by the locale or plperl issues described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix Windows code so that postmaster will continue rather than exit
       if there is no more room in ShmemBackendArray (Magnus)
       The previous behavior could lead to a denial-of-service situation
       if too many connection requests arrive close together. This applies
       *only* to the Windows port.
     * Fix bug introduced in 8.0 that could allow ReadBuffer to return an
       already-used page as new, potentially causing loss of
       recently-committed data (Tom)
     * Fix for protocol-level Describe messages issued outside a
       transaction or in a failed transaction (Tom)
     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You might need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Allow more flexible relocation of installation directories (Tom)
       Previous releases supported relocation only if all installation
       directory paths were the same except for the last component.
     * Prevent crashes caused by the use of ISO-8859-5 and ISO-8859-9
       encodings (Tatsuo)
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Fix bug where COPY CSV mode considered any \. to terminate the copy
       data
       The new code requires \. to appear alone on a line, as per
       documentation.
     * Make COPY CSV mode quote a literal data value of \. to ensure it
       cannot be interpreted as the end-of-data marker (Bruce)
     * Various fixes for functions returning RECORDs (Tom)
     * Fix processing of "postgresql.conf" so a final line with no newline
       is processed properly (Tom)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix autovacuum crash when processing expression indexes
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)

Changes

     * Fix incorrect optimizations of outer-join conditions (Tom)
     * Fix problems with wrong reported column names in cases involving
       sub-selects flattened by the optimizer (Tom)
     * Fix update failures in scenarios involving CHECK constraints,
       toasted columns, *and* indexes (Tom)
     * Fix bgwriter problems after recovering from errors (Tom)
       The background writer was found to leak buffer pins after write
       errors. While not fatal in itself, this might lead to mysterious
       blockages of later VACUUM commands.
     * Prevent failure if client sends Bind protocol message when current
       transaction is already aborted
     * "/contrib/tsearch2" and "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix problems with translated error messages in languages that
       require word reordering, such as Turkish; also problems with
       unexpected truncation of output strings and wrong display of the
       smallest possible bigint value (Andrew, Tom)
       These problems only appeared on platforms that were using our
       "port/snprintf.c" code, which includes BSD variants if --enable-nls
       was given, and perhaps others. In addition, a different form of the
       translated-error-message problem could appear on Windows depending
       on which version of "libintl" was used.
     * Re-allow AM/PM, HH, HH12, and D format specifiers for to_char(time)
       and to_char(interval). (to_char(interval) should probably use
       HH24.) (Bruce)
     * AIX, HPUX, and MSVC compile fixes (Tom, Hiroshi Saito)
     * Optimizer improvements (Tom)
     * Retry file reads and writes after Windows NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES error
       (Qingqing Zhou)
     * Prevent autovacuum from crashing during ANALYZE of expression index
       (Alvaro)
     * Fix problems with ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS temp tables
     * Fix problems when a trigger alters the output of a SELECT DISTINCT
       query
     * Add 8.1.0 release note item on how to migrate invalid UTF-8 byte
       sequences (Paul Lindner)

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   Improve concurrent access to the shared buffer cache (Tom)
          Access to the shared buffer cache was identified as a
          significant scalability problem, particularly on multi-CPU
          systems. In this release, the way that locking is done in the
          buffer manager has been overhauled to reduce lock contention and
          improve scalability. The buffer manager has also been changed to
          use a "clock sweep" replacement policy.

   Allow index scans to use an intermediate in-memory bitmap (Tom)
          In previous releases, only a single index could be used to do
          lookups on a table. With this feature, if a query has "WHERE
          tab.col1 = 4 and tab.col2 = 9", and there is no multicolumn
          index on col1 and col2, but there is an index on col1 and
          another on col2, it is possible to search both indexes and
          combine the results in memory, then do heap fetches for only the
          rows matching both the col1 and col2 restrictions. This is very
          useful in environments that have a lot of unstructured queries
          where it is impossible to create indexes that match all possible
          access conditions. Bitmap scans are useful even with a single
          index, as they reduce the amount of random access needed; a
          bitmap index scan is efficient for retrieving fairly large
          fractions of the complete table, whereas plain index scans are
          not.

   Add two-phase commit (Heikki Linnakangas, Alvaro, Tom)
          Two-phase commit allows transactions to be "prepared" on several
          computers, and once all computers have successfully prepared
          their transactions (none failed), all transactions can be
          committed. Even if a machine crashes after a prepare, the
          prepared transaction can be committed after the machine is
          restarted. New syntax includes "PREPARE TRANSACTION" and
          "COMMIT/ROLLBACK PREPARED". A new system view pg_prepared_xacts
          has also been added.

   Create a new role system that replaces users and groups (Stephen Frost)
          Roles are a combination of users and groups. Like users, they
          can have login capability, and like groups, a role can have
          other roles as members. Roles basically remove the distinction
          between users and groups. For example, a role can:

          + Have login capability (optionally)
          + Own objects
          + Hold access permissions for database objects
          + Inherit permissions from other roles it is a member of

          Once a user logs into a role, she obtains capabilities of the
          login role plus any inherited roles, and can use "SET ROLE" to
          switch to other roles she is a member of. This feature is a
          generalization of the SQL standard's concept of roles. This
          change also replaces pg_shadow and pg_group by new role-capable
          catalogs pg_authid and pg_auth_members. The old tables are
          redefined as read-only views on the new role tables.

   Automatically use indexes for MIN() and MAX() (Tom)
          In previous releases, the only way to use an index for MIN() or
          MAX() was to rewrite the query as "SELECT col FROM tab ORDER BY
          col LIMIT 1". Index usage now happens automatically.

   Move /contrib/pg_autovacuum into the main server (Alvaro)
          Integrating autovacuum into the server allows it to be
          automatically started and stopped in sync with the database
          server, and allows autovacuum to be configured from
          "postgresql.conf".

   Add shared row level locks using SELECT ... FOR SHARE (Alvaro)
          While PostgreSQL's MVCC locking allows "SELECT" to never be
          blocked by writers and therefore does not need shared row locks
          for typical operations, shared locks are useful for applications
          that require shared row locking. In particular this reduces the
          locking requirements imposed by referential integrity checks.

   Add dependencies on shared objects, specifically roles (Alvaro)
          This extension of the dependency mechanism prevents roles from
          being dropped while there are still database objects they own.
          Formerly it was possible to accidentally "orphan" objects by
          deleting their owner. While this could be recovered from, it was
          messy and unpleasant.

   Improve performance for partitioned tables (Simon)
          The new constraint_exclusion configuration parameter avoids
          lookups on child tables where constraints indicate that no
          matching rows exist in the child table.

          This allows for a basic type of table partitioning. If child
          tables store separate key ranges and this is enforced using
          appropriate "CHECK" constraints, the optimizer will skip child
          table accesses when the constraint guarantees no matching rows
          exist in the child table.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.1

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   The 8.0 release announced that the to_char() function for intervals
   would be removed in 8.1. However, since no better API has been
   suggested, to_char(interval) has been enhanced in 8.1 and will remain
   in the server.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * add_missing_from is now false by default (Neil)
       By default, we now generate an error if a table is used in a query
       without a FROM reference. The old behavior is still available, but
       the parameter must be set to 'true' to obtain it.
       It might be necessary to set add_missing_from to true in order to
       load an existing dump file, if the dump contains any views or rules
       created using the implicit-FROM syntax. This should be a one-time
       annoyance, because PostgreSQL 8.1 will convert such views and rules
       to standard explicit-FROM syntax. Subsequent dumps will therefore
       not have the problem.
     * Cause input of a zero-length string ('') for float4/float8/oid to
       throw an error, rather than treating it as a zero (Neil)
       This change is consistent with the current handling of zero-length
       strings for integers. The schedule for this change was announced in
       8.0.
     * default_with_oids is now false by default (Neil)
       With this option set to false, user-created tables no longer have
       an OID column unless "WITH OIDS" is specified in "CREATE TABLE".
       Though OIDs have existed in all releases of PostgreSQL, their use
       is limited because they are only four bytes long and the counter is
       shared across all installed databases. The preferred way of
       uniquely identifying rows is via sequences and the SERIAL type,
       which have been supported since PostgreSQL 6.4.
     * Add E'' syntax so eventually ordinary strings can treat backslashes
       literally (Bruce)
       Currently PostgreSQL processes a backslash in a string literal as
       introducing a special escape sequence, e.g. \n or \010. While this
       allows easy entry of special values, it is nonstandard and makes
       porting of applications from other databases more difficult. For
       this reason, the PostgreSQL project is planning to remove the
       special meaning of backslashes in strings. For backward
       compatibility and for users who want special backslash processing,
       a new string syntax has been created. This new string syntax is
       formed by writing an E immediately preceding the single quote that
       starts the string, e.g. E'hi\n'. While this release does not change
       the handling of backslashes in strings, it does add new
       configuration parameters to help users migrate applications for
       future releases:
          + standard_conforming_strings -- does this release treat
            backslashes literally in ordinary strings?
          + escape_string_warning -- warn about backslashes in ordinary
            (non-E) strings
       The standard_conforming_strings value is read-only. Applications
       can retrieve the value to know how backslashes are processed.
       (Presence of the parameter can also be taken as an indication that
       E'' string syntax is supported.) In a future release,
       standard_conforming_strings will be true, meaning backslashes will
       be treated literally in non-E strings. To prepare for this change,
       use E'' strings in places that need special backslash processing,
       and turn on escape_string_warning to find additional strings that
       need to be converted to use E''. Also, use two single-quotes ('')
       to embed a literal single-quote in a string, rather than the
       PostgreSQL-supported syntax of backslash single-quote (\'). The
       former is standards-conforming and does not require the use of the
       E'' string syntax. You can also use the $$ string syntax, which
       does not treat backslashes specially.
     * Make "REINDEX DATABASE" reindex all indexes in the database (Tom)
       Formerly, "REINDEX DATABASE" reindexed only system tables. This new
       behavior seems more intuitive. A new command "REINDEX SYSTEM"
       provides the old functionality of reindexing just the system
       tables.
     * Read-only large object descriptors now obey MVCC snapshot semantics
       When a large object is opened with INV_READ (and not INV_WRITE),
       the data read from the descriptor will now reflect a "snapshot" of
       the large object's state at the time of the transaction snapshot in
       use by the query that called lo_open(). To obtain the old behavior
       of always returning the latest committed data, include INV_WRITE in
       the mode flags for lo_open().
     * Add proper dependencies for arguments of sequence functions (Tom)
       In previous releases, sequence names passed to nextval(),
       currval(), and setval() were stored as simple text strings, meaning
       that renaming or dropping a sequence used in a DEFAULT clause made
       the clause invalid. This release stores all newly-created sequence
       function arguments as internal OIDs, allowing them to track
       sequence renaming, and adding dependency information that prevents
       improper sequence removal. It also makes such DEFAULT clauses
       immune to schema renaming and search path changes.
       Some applications might rely on the old behavior of run-time lookup
       for sequence names. This can still be done by explicitly casting
       the argument to text, for example nextval('myseq'::text).
       Pre-8.1 database dumps loaded into 8.1 will use the old text-based
       representation and therefore will not have the features of
       OID-stored arguments. However, it is possible to update a database
       containing text-based DEFAULT clauses. First, save this query into
       a file, such as "fixseq.sql":
SELECT  'ALTER TABLE ' ||
   pg_catalog.quote_ident(n.nspname) || '.' ||
   pg_catalog.quote_ident(c.relname) ||
   ' ALTER COLUMN ' || pg_catalog.quote_ident(a.attname) ||
   ' SET DEFAULT ' ||
   regexp_replace(d.adsrc,
                  $$val\(\(('[^']*')::text\)::regclass$$,
                  $$val(\1$$,
                  'g') ||
   ';'
FROM    pg_namespace n, pg_class c, pg_attribute a, pg_attrdef d
WHERE   n.oid = c.relnamespace AND
   c.oid = a.attrelid AND
   a.attrelid = d.adrelid AND
   a.attnum = d.adnum AND
   d.adsrc ~ $$val\(\('[^']*'::text\)::regclass$$;
       Next, run the query against a database to find what adjustments are
       required, like this for database db1:
psql -t -f fixseq.sql db1
       This will show the "ALTER TABLE" commands needed to convert the
       database to the newer OID-based representation. If the commands
       look reasonable, run this to update the database:
psql -t -f fixseq.sql db1 | psql -e db1
       This process must be repeated in each database to be updated.
     * In psql, treat unquoted \{digit}+ sequences as octal (Bruce)
       In previous releases, \{digit}+ sequences were treated as decimal,
       and only \0{digit}+ were treated as octal. This change was made for
       consistency.
     * Remove grammar productions for prefix and postfix % and ^ operators
       (Tom)
       These have never been documented and complicated the use of the
       modulus operator (%) with negative numbers.
     * Make &< and &> for polygons consistent with the box "over"
       operators (Tom)
     * "CREATE LANGUAGE" can ignore the provided arguments in favor of
       information from pg_pltemplate (Tom)
       A new system catalog pg_pltemplate has been defined to carry
       information about the preferred definitions of procedural languages
       (such as whether they have validator functions). When an entry
       exists in this catalog for the language being created, "CREATE
       LANGUAGE" will ignore all its parameters except the language name
       and instead use the catalog information. This measure was taken
       because of increasing problems with obsolete language definitions
       being loaded by old dump files. As of 8.1, pg_dump will dump
       procedural language definitions as just "CREATE LANGUAGE name",
       relying on a template entry to exist at load time. We expect this
       will be a more future-proof representation.
     * Make pg_cancel_backend(int) return a boolean rather than an integer
       (Neil)
     * Some users are having problems loading UTF-8 data into 8.1.X. This
       is because previous versions allowed invalid UTF-8 byte sequences
       to be entered into the database, and this release properly accepts
       only valid UTF-8 sequences. One way to correct a dumpfile is to run
       the command "iconv -c -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 -o cleanfile.sql
       dumpfile.sql". The -c option removes invalid character sequences. A
       diff of the two files will show the sequences that are invalid.
       "iconv" reads the entire input file into memory so it might be
       necessary to use split to break up the dump into multiple smaller
       files for processing.

Additional Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the additional changes
   between PostgreSQL 8.1 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance Improvements

     * Improve GiST and R-tree index performance (Neil)
     * Improve the optimizer, including auto-resizing of hash joins (Tom)
     * Overhaul internal API in several areas
     * Change WAL record CRCs from 64-bit to 32-bit (Tom)
       We determined that the extra cost of computing 64-bit CRCs was
       significant, and the gain in reliability too marginal to justify
       it.
     * Prevent writing large empty gaps in WAL pages (Tom)
     * Improve spinlock behavior on SMP machines, particularly Opterons
       (Tom)
     * Allow nonconsecutive index columns to be used in a multicolumn
       index (Tom)
       For example, this allows an index on columns a,b,c to be used in a
       query with "WHERE a = 4 and c = 10".
     * Skip WAL logging for "CREATE TABLE AS" / "SELECT INTO" (Simon)
       Since a crash during "CREATE TABLE AS" would cause the table to be
       dropped during recovery, there is no reason to WAL log as the table
       is loaded. (Logging still happens if WAL archiving is enabled,
       however.)
     * Allow concurrent GiST index access (Teodor, Oleg)
     * Add configuration parameter full_page_writes to control writing
       full pages to WAL (Bruce)
       To prevent partial disk writes from corrupting the database,
       PostgreSQL writes a complete copy of each database disk page to WAL
       the first time it is modified after a checkpoint. This option turns
       off that functionality for more speed. This is safe to use with
       battery-backed disk caches where partial page writes cannot happen.
     * Use O_DIRECT if available when using O_SYNC for wal_sync_method
       (Itagaki Takahiro)
       O_DIRECT causes disk writes to bypass the kernel cache, and for WAL
       writes, this improves performance.
     * Improve "COPY FROM" performance (Alon Goldshuv)
       This was accomplished by reading "COPY" input in larger chunks,
       rather than character by character.
     * Improve the performance of COUNT(), SUM, AVG(), STDDEV(), and
       VARIANCE() (Neil, Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Changes

     * Prevent problems due to transaction ID (XID) wraparound (Tom)
       The server will now warn when the transaction counter approaches
       the wraparound point. If the counter becomes too close to
       wraparound, the server will stop accepting queries. This ensures
       that data is not lost before needed vacuuming is performed.
     * Fix problems with object IDs (OIDs) conflicting with existing
       system objects after the OID counter has wrapped around (Tom)
     * Add warning about the need to increase max_fsm_relations and
       max_fsm_pages during "VACUUM" (Ron Mayer)
     * Add temp_buffers configuration parameter to allow users to
       determine the size of the local buffer area for temporary table
       access (Tom)
     * Add session start time and client IP address to pg_stat_activity
       (Magnus)
     * Adjust pg_stat views for bitmap scans (Tom)
       The meanings of some of the fields have changed slightly.
     * Enhance pg_locks view (Tom)
     * Log queries for client-side "PREPARE" and "EXECUTE" (Simon)
     * Allow Kerberos name and user name case sensitivity to be specified
       in "postgresql.conf" (Magnus)
     * Add configuration parameter krb_server_hostname so that the server
       host name can be specified as part of service principal (Todd
       Kover)
       If not set, any service principal matching an entry in the keytab
       can be used. This is new Kerberos matching behavior in this
       release.
     * Add log_line_prefix options for millisecond timestamps (%m) and
       remote host (%h) (Ed L.)
     * Add WAL logging for GiST indexes (Teodor, Oleg)
       GiST indexes are now safe for crash and point-in-time recovery.
     * Remove old "*.backup" files when we do pg_stop_backup() (Bruce)
       This prevents a large number of "*.backup" files from existing in
       "pg_xlog/".
     * Add configuration parameters to control TCP/IP keep-alive times for
       idle, interval, and count (Oliver Jowett)
       These values can be changed to allow more rapid detection of lost
       client connections.
     * Add per-user and per-database connection limits (Petr Jelinek)
       Using "ALTER USER" and "ALTER DATABASE", limits can now be enforced
       on the maximum number of sessions that can concurrently connect as
       a specific user or to a specific database. Setting the limit to
       zero disables user or database connections.
     * Allow more than two gigabytes of shared memory and per-backend work
       memory on 64-bit machines (Koichi Suzuki)
     * New system catalog pg_pltemplate allows overriding obsolete
       procedural-language definitions in dump files (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Query Changes

     * Add temporary views (Koju Iijima, Neil)
     * Fix "HAVING" without any aggregate functions or "GROUP BY" so that
       the query returns a single group (Tom)
       Previously, such a case would treat the "HAVING" clause the same as
       a "WHERE" clause. This was not per spec.
     * Add "USING" clause to allow additional tables to be specified to
       "DELETE" (Euler Taveira de Oliveira, Neil)
       In prior releases, there was no clear method for specifying
       additional tables to be used for joins in a "DELETE" statement.
       "UPDATE" already has a FROM clause for this purpose.
     * Add support for \x hex escapes in backend and ecpg strings (Bruce)
       This is just like the standard C \x escape syntax. Octal escapes
       were already supported.
     * Add "BETWEEN SYMMETRIC" query syntax (Pavel Stehule)
       This feature allows "BETWEEN" comparisons without requiring the
       first value to be less than the second. For example, "2 BETWEEN
       [ASYMMETRIC] 3 AND 1" returns false, while "2 BETWEEN SYMMETRIC 3
       AND 1" returns true. "BETWEEN ASYMMETRIC" was already supported.
     * Add "NOWAIT" option to "SELECT ... FOR UPDATE/SHARE" (Hans-Juergen
       Schoenig)
       While the statement_timeout configuration parameter allows a query
       taking more than a certain amount of time to be cancelled, the
       "NOWAIT" option allows a query to be canceled as soon as a "SELECT
       ... FOR UPDATE/SHARE" command cannot immediately acquire a row
       lock.

Object Manipulation Changes

     * Track dependencies of shared objects (Alvaro)
       PostgreSQL allows global tables (users, databases, tablespaces) to
       reference information in multiple databases. This addition adds
       dependency information for global tables, so, for example, user
       ownership can be tracked across databases, so a user who owns
       something in any database can no longer be removed. Dependency
       tracking already existed for database-local objects.
     * Allow limited "ALTER OWNER" commands to be performed by the object
       owner (Stephen Frost)
       Prior releases allowed only superusers to change object owners.
       Now, ownership can be transferred if the user executing the command
       owns the object and would be able to create it as the new owner
       (that is, the user is a member of the new owning role and that role
       has the CREATE permission that would be needed to create the object
       afresh).
     * Add "ALTER" object "SET SCHEMA" capability for some object types
       (tables, functions, types) (Bernd Helmle)
       This allows objects to be moved to different schemas.
     * Add "ALTER TABLE ENABLE/DISABLE TRIGGER" to disable triggers
       (Satoshi Nagayasu)
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Command Changes

     * Allow "TRUNCATE" to truncate multiple tables in a single command
       (Alvaro)
       Because of referential integrity checks, it is not allowed to
       truncate a table that is part of a referential integrity
       constraint. Using this new functionality, "TRUNCATE" can be used to
       truncate such tables, if both tables involved in a referential
       integrity constraint are truncated in a single "TRUNCATE" command.
     * Properly process carriage returns and line feeds in "COPY CSV" mode
       (Andrew)
       In release 8.0, carriage returns and line feeds in "CSV COPY TO"
       were processed in an inconsistent manner. (This was documented on
       the TODO list.)
     * Add "COPY WITH CSV HEADER" to allow a header line as the first line
       in "COPY" (Andrew)
       This allows handling of the common "CSV" usage of placing the
       column names on the first line of the data file. For "COPY TO", the
       first line contains the column names, and for "COPY FROM", the
       first line is ignored.
     * On Windows, display better sub-second precision in "EXPLAIN
       ANALYZE" (Magnus)
     * Add trigger duration display to "EXPLAIN ANALYZE" (Tom)
       Prior releases included trigger execution time as part of the total
       execution time, but did not show it separately. It is now possible
       to see how much time is spent in each trigger.
     * Add support for \x hex escapes in "COPY" (Sergey Ten)
       Previous releases only supported octal escapes.
     * Make "SHOW ALL" include variable descriptions (Matthias Schmidt)
       "SHOW" varname still only displays the variable's value and does
       not include the description.
     * Make initdb create a new standard database called postgres, and
       convert utilities to use postgres rather than template1 for
       standard lookups (Dave)
       In prior releases, template1 was used both as a default connection
       for utilities like createuser, and as a template for new databases.
       This caused "CREATE DATABASE" to sometimes fail, because a new
       database cannot be created if anyone else is in the template
       database. With this change, the default connection database is now
       postgres, meaning it is much less likely someone will be using
       template1 during "CREATE DATABASE".
     * Create new reindexdb command-line utility by moving
       "/contrib/reindexdb" into the server (Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Type and Function Changes

     * Add MAX() and MIN() aggregates for array types (Koju Iijima)
     * Fix to_date() and to_timestamp() to behave reasonably when CC and
       YY fields are both used (Karel Zak)
       If the format specification contains CC and a year specification is
       YYY or longer, ignore the CC. If the year specification is YY or
       shorter, interpret CC as the previous century.
     * Add md5(bytea) (Abhijit Menon-Sen)
       md5(text) already existed.
     * Add support for "numeric ^ numeric" based on power(numeric,
       numeric)
       The function already existed, but there was no operator assigned to
       it.
     * Fix NUMERIC modulus by properly truncating the quotient during
       computation (Bruce)
       In previous releases, modulus for large values sometimes returned
       negative results due to rounding of the quotient.
     * Add a function lastval() (Dennis Bjrklund)
       lastval() is a simplified version of currval(). It automatically
       determines the proper sequence name based on the most recent
       nextval() or setval() call performed by the current session.
     * Add to_timestamp(DOUBLE PRECISION) (Michael Glaesemann)
       Converts Unix seconds since 1970 to a TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE.
     * Add pg_postmaster_start_time() function (Euler Taveira de Oliveira,
       Matthias Schmidt)
     * Allow the full use of time zone names in "AT TIME ZONE", not just
       the short list previously available (Magnus)
       Previously, only a predefined list of time zone names were
       supported by "AT TIME ZONE". Now any supported time zone name can
       be used, e.g.:
        SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/London';

       In the above query, the time zone used is adjusted based on the
       daylight saving time rules that were in effect on the supplied
       date.
     * Add GREATEST() and LEAST() variadic functions (Pavel Stehule)
       These functions take a variable number of arguments and return the
       greatest or least value among the arguments.
     * Add pg_column_size() (Mark Kirkwood)
       This returns storage size of a column, which might be compressed.
     * Add regexp_replace() (Atsushi Ogawa)
       This allows regular expression replacement, like sed. An optional
       flag argument allows selection of global (replace all) and
       case-insensitive modes.
     * Fix interval division and multiplication (Bruce)
       Previous versions sometimes returned unjustified results, like "'4
       months'::interval / 5" returning "'1 mon -6 days'".
     * Fix roundoff behavior in timestamp, time, and interval output (Tom)
       This fixes some cases in which the seconds field would be shown as
       60 instead of incrementing the higher-order fields.
     * Add a separate day field to type interval so a one day interval can
       be distinguished from a 24 hour interval (Michael Glaesemann)
       Days that contain a daylight saving time adjustment are not 24
       hours long, but typically 23 or 25 hours. This change creates a
       conceptual distinction between intervals of "so many days" and
       intervals of "so many hours". Adding 1 day to a timestamp now gives
       the same local time on the next day even if a daylight saving time
       adjustment occurs between, whereas adding 24 hours will give a
       different local time when this happens. For example, under US DST
       rules:
        '2005-04-03 00:00:00-05' + '1 day' = '2005-04-04 00:00:00-04'
        '2005-04-03 00:00:00-05' + '24 hours' = '2005-04-04 01:00:00-04'

     * Add justify_days() and justify_hours() (Michael Glaesemann)
       These functions, respectively, adjust days to an appropriate number
       of full months and days, and adjust hours to an appropriate number
       of full days and hours.
     * Move "/contrib/dbsize" into the backend, and rename some of the
       functions (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
          + pg_tablespace_size()
          + pg_database_size()
          + pg_relation_size()
          + pg_total_relation_size()
          + pg_size_pretty()
       pg_total_relation_size() includes indexes and TOAST tables.
     * Add functions for read-only file access to the cluster directory
       (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
          + pg_stat_file()
          + pg_read_file()
          + pg_ls_dir()
     * Add pg_reload_conf() to force reloading of the configuration files
       (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
     * Add pg_rotate_logfile() to force rotation of the server log file
       (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
     * Change pg_stat_* views to include TOAST tables (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Encoding and Locale Changes

     * Rename some encodings to be more consistent and to follow
       international standards (Bruce)
          + UNICODE is now UTF8
          + ALT is now WIN866
          + WIN is now WIN1251
          + TCVN is now WIN1258
       The original names still work.
     * Add support for WIN1252 encoding (Roland Volkmann)
     * Add support for four-byte UTF8 characters (John Hansen)
       Previously only one, two, and three-byte UTF8 characters were
       supported. This is particularly important for support for some
       Chinese character sets.
     * Allow direct conversion between EUC_JP and SJIS to improve
       performance (Atsushi Ogawa)
     * Allow the UTF8 encoding to work on Windows (Magnus)
       This is done by mapping UTF8 to the Windows-native UTF16
       implementation.
     __________________________________________________________________

General Server-Side Language Changes

     * Fix "ALTER LANGUAGE RENAME" (Sergey Yatskevich)
     * Allow function characteristics, like strictness and volatility, to
       be modified via "ALTER FUNCTION" (Neil)
     * Increase the maximum number of function arguments to 100 (Tom)
     * Allow SQL and PL/PgSQL functions to use "OUT" and "INOUT"
       parameters (Tom)
       "OUT" is an alternate way for a function to return values. Instead
       of using "RETURN", values can be returned by assigning to
       parameters declared as "OUT" or "INOUT". This is notationally
       simpler in some cases, particularly so when multiple values need to
       be returned. While returning multiple values from a function was
       possible in previous releases, this greatly simplifies the process.
       (The feature will be extended to other server-side languages in
       future releases.)
     * Move language handler functions into the pg_catalog schema
       This makes it easier to drop the public schema if desired.
     * Add SPI_getnspname() to SPI (Neil)
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/PgSQL Server-Side Language Changes

     * Overhaul the memory management of PL/PgSQL functions (Neil)
       The parsetree of each function is now stored in a separate memory
       context. This allows this memory to be easily reclaimed when it is
       no longer needed.
     * Check function syntax at "CREATE FUNCTION" time, rather than at
       runtime (Neil)
       Previously, most syntax errors were reported only when the function
       was executed.
     * Allow "OPEN" to open non-"SELECT" queries like "EXPLAIN" and "SHOW"
       (Tom)
     * No longer require functions to issue a "RETURN" statement (Tom)
       This is a byproduct of the newly added "OUT" and "INOUT"
       functionality. "RETURN" can be omitted when it is not needed to
       provide the function's return value.
     * Add support for an optional "INTO" clause to PL/PgSQL's "EXECUTE"
       statement (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
     * Make "CREATE TABLE AS" set "ROW_COUNT" (Tom)
     * Define SQLSTATE and SQLERRM to return the SQLSTATE and error
       message of the current exception (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
       These variables are only defined inside exception blocks.
     * Allow the parameters to the "RAISE" statement to be expressions
       (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
     * Add a loop "CONTINUE" statement (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
     * Allow block and loop labels (Pavel Stehule)
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/Perl Server-Side Language Changes

     * Allow large result sets to be returned efficiently (Abhijit
       Menon-Sen)
       This allows functions to use return_next() to avoid building the
       entire result set in memory.
     * Allow one-row-at-a-time retrieval of query results (Abhijit
       Menon-Sen)
       This allows functions to use spi_query() and spi_fetchrow() to
       avoid accumulating the entire result set in memory.
     * Force PL/Perl to handle strings as UTF8 if the server encoding is
       UTF8 (David Kamholz)
     * Add a validator function for PL/Perl (Andrew)
       This allows syntax errors to be reported at definition time, rather
       than execution time.
     * Allow PL/Perl to return a Perl array when the function returns an
       array type (Andrew)
       This basically maps PostgreSQL arrays to Perl arrays.
     * Allow Perl nonfatal warnings to generate "NOTICE" messages (Andrew)
     * Allow Perl's strict mode to be enabled (Andrew)
     __________________________________________________________________

psql Changes

     * Add "\set ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK" to allow statements in a transaction
       to error without affecting the rest of the transaction (Greg Sabino
       Mullane)
       This is basically implemented by wrapping every statement in a
       sub-transaction.
     * Add support for \x hex strings in psql variables (Bruce)
       Octal escapes were already supported.
     * Add support for "troff -ms" output format (Roger Leigh)
     * Allow the history file location to be controlled by HISTFILE
       (Andreas Seltenreich)
       This allows configuration of per-database history storage.
     * Prevent "\x" (expanded mode) from affecting the output of "\d
       tablename" (Neil)
     * Add "-L" option to psql to log sessions (Lorne Sunley)
       This option was added because some operating systems do not have
       simple command-line activity logging functionality.
     * Make "\d" show the tablespaces of indexes (Qingqing Zhou)
     * Allow psql help ("\h") to make a best guess on the proper help
       information (Greg Sabino Mullane)
       This allows the user to just add "\h" to the front of the syntax
       error query and get help on the supported syntax. Previously any
       additional query text beyond the command name had to be removed to
       use "\h".
     * Add "\pset numericlocale" to allow numbers to be output in a
       locale-aware format (Eugen Nedelcu)
       For example, using C locale 100000 would be output as 100,000.0
       while a European locale might output this value as 100.000,0.
     * Make startup banner show both server version number and psql's
       version number, when they are different (Bruce)
       Also, a warning will be shown if the server and psql are from
       different major releases.
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump Changes

     * Add "-n" / "--schema" switch to pg_restore (Richard van den Berg)
       This allows just the objects in a specified schema to be restored.
     * Allow pg_dump to dump large objects even in text mode (Tom)
       With this change, large objects are now always dumped; the former
       "-b" switch is a no-op.
     * Allow pg_dump to dump a consistent snapshot of large objects (Tom)
     * Dump comments for large objects (Tom)
     * Add "--encoding" to pg_dump (Magnus Hagander)
       This allows a database to be dumped in an encoding that is
       different from the server's encoding. This is valuable when
       transferring the dump to a machine with a different encoding.
     * Rely on pg_pltemplate for procedural languages (Tom)
       If the call handler for a procedural language is in the pg_catalog
       schema, pg_dump does not dump the handler. Instead, it dumps the
       language using just "CREATE LANGUAGE name", relying on the
       pg_pltemplate catalog to provide the language's creation parameters
       at load time.
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq Changes

     * Add a PGPASSFILE environment variable to specify the password
       file's filename (Andrew)
     * Add lo_create(), that is similar to lo_creat() but allows the OID
       of the large object to be specified (Tom)
     * Make libpq consistently return an error to the client application
       on malloc() failure (Neil)
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code Changes

     * Fix pgxs to support building against a relocated installation
     * Add spinlock support for the Itanium processor using Intel compiler
       (Vikram Kalsi)
     * Add Kerberos 5 support for Windows (Magnus)
     * Add Chinese FAQ (laser@pgsqldb.com)
     * Rename Rendezvous to Bonjour to match OS/X feature renaming (Bruce)
     * Add support for fsync_writethrough on Darwin (Chris Campbell)
     * Streamline the passing of information within the server, the
       optimizer, and the lock system (Tom)
     * Allow pg_config to be compiled using MSVC (Andrew)
       This is required to build DBD::Pg using MSVC.
     * Remove support for Kerberos V4 (Magnus)
       Kerberos 4 had security vulnerabilities and is no longer
       maintained.
     * Code cleanups (Coverity static analysis performed by EnterpriseDB)
     * Modify "postgresql.conf" to use documentation defaults on/off
       rather than true/false (Bruce)
     * Enhance pg_config to be able to report more build-time values (Tom)
     * Allow libpq to be built thread-safe on Windows (Dave Page)
     * Allow IPv6 connections to be used on Windows (Andrew)
     * Add Server Administration documentation about I/O subsystem
       reliability (Bruce)
     * Move private declarations from "gist.h" to "gist_private.h" (Neil)
       In previous releases, "gist.h" contained both the public GiST API
       (intended for use by authors of GiST index implementations) as well
       as some private declarations used by the implementation of GiST
       itself. The latter have been moved to a separate file,
       "gist_private.h". Most GiST index implementations should be
       unaffected.
     * Overhaul GiST memory management (Neil)
       GiST methods are now always invoked in a short-lived memory
       context. Therefore, memory allocated via palloc() will be reclaimed
       automatically, so GiST index implementations do not need to
       manually release allocated memory via pfree().
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib Changes

     * Add "/contrib/pg_buffercache" contrib module (Mark Kirkwood)
       This displays the contents of the buffer cache, for debugging and
       performance tuning purposes.
     * Remove "/contrib/array" because it is obsolete (Tom)
     * Clean up the "/contrib/lo" module (Tom)
     * Move "/contrib/findoidjoins" to "/src/tools" (Tom)
     * Remove the <<, >>, &<, and &> operators from "/contrib/cube"
       These operators were not useful.
     * Improve "/contrib/btree_gist" (Janko Richter)
     * Improve "/contrib/pgbench" (Tomoaki Sato, Tatsuo)
       There is now a facility for testing with SQL command scripts given
       by the user, instead of only a hard-wired command sequence.
     * Improve "/contrib/pgcrypto" (Marko Kreen)
          + Implementation of OpenPGP symmetric-key and public-key
            encryption
            Both RSA and Elgamal public-key algorithms are supported.
          + Stand alone build: include SHA256/384/512 hashes, Fortuna PRNG
          + OpenSSL build: support 3DES, use internal AES with OpenSSL <
            0.9.7
          + Take build parameters (OpenSSL, zlib) from "configure" result
            There is no need to edit the "Makefile" anymore.
          + Remove support for "libmhash" and "libmcrypt"

                               Release 8.0.23

     Release date: 2009-12-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.22. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.23

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.22, see the release notes
   for 8.0.22.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
       changing session-local state (Gurjeet Singh, Tom)
       This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions from
       possibly subverting a superuser's session (CVE-2009-4136).
     * Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
       common name (CN) field (Magnus)
       This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a server or
       client name during SSL validation (CVE-2009-4034).
     * Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization
       (Tom)
     * Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)
       This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's
       already committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
       if a plain VACUUM is interrupted after having truncated the table.
     * Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
       calculation (Tom)
       This could occur with extremely large planner estimates for the
       size of a hashjoin's result.
     * Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons (Chris Mikkelson)
     * Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
       accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
     * Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)
       The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
       Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
       domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
       was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
       stack would pass to it.
     * Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python (Peter)
     * Ensure psql's flex module is compiled with the correct system
       header definitions (Tom)
       This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile
       causes incompatible changes in the generated code.
     * Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
       connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
       libpq versions (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
       changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji, Novokuznetsk,
       Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also historical corrections for
       Hong Kong.

                               Release 8.0.22

     Release date: 2009-09-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.21. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.22

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you

   earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)
       This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch that
       disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions. (See CVE-2007-6600)
     * Fix handling of sub-SELECTs appearing in the arguments of an
       outer-level aggregate function (Tom)
     * Fix hash calculation for data type interval (Tom)
       This corrects wrong results for hash joins on interval values. It
       also changes the contents of hash indexes on interval columns. If
       you have any such indexes, you must "REINDEX" them after updating.
     * Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
       'HH'/'HH12' (Heikki)
       It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
     * Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
       and integer datetimes are in use (Alex Hunsaker)
     * Fix calculation of distance between a point and a line segment
       (Tom)
       This led to incorrect results from a number of geometric operators.
     * Fix money data type to work in locales where currency amounts have
       no fractional digits, e.g. Japan (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Properly round datetime input like
       00:12:57.9999999999999999999999999999 (Tom)
     * Fix poor choice of page split point in GiST R-tree operator classes
       (Teodor)
     * Fix portability issues in plperl initialization (Andrew Dunstan)
     * Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
       empty (Jeff Davis)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
       number of parameters (twenty) (Tom)
     * Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
       "COPY FROM STDIN" (Tom)
     * Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
       both libraries are installed (Zdenek Kotala)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009l for DST law
       changes in Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Argentina/San_Luis,
       Cuba, Jordan (historical correction only), Mauritius, Morocco,
       Palestine, Syria, Tunisia.

                               Release 8.0.21

     Release date: 2009-03-16

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.20. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.21

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails
       (Tom)
       This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
       related failure scenarios. The previous fixes were narrowly
       tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now
       recognized that *any* error thrown by an encoding conversion
       function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying
       to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable
       translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form
       of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive
       error reporting situation. (CVE-2009-0922)
     * Disallow "CREATE CONVERSION" with the wrong encodings for the
       specified conversion function (Heikki)
       This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion
       failure. The previous change is a backstop to guard against other
       kinds of failures in the same area.
     * Fix core dump when to_char() is given format codes that are
       inappropriate for the type of the data argument (Tom)
     * Add MUST (Mauritius Island Summer Time) to the default list of
       known timezone abbreviations (Xavier Bugaud)

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.19. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.20

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Improve handling of URLs in headline() function (Teodor)
     * Improve handling of overlength headlines in headline() function
       (Teodor)
     * Prevent possible Assert failure or misconversion if an encoding
       conversion is created with the wrong conversion function for the
       specified pair of encodings (Tom, Heikki)
     * Avoid unnecessary locking of small tables in "VACUUM" (Heikki)
     * Fix uninitialized variables in "contrib/tsearch2"'s get_covers()
       function (Teodor)
     * Make all documentation reference pgsql-bugs and/or pgsql-hackers as
       appropriate, instead of the now-decommissioned pgsql-ports and
       pgsql-patches mailing lists (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009a (for Kathmandu
       and historical DST corrections in Switzerland, Cuba)

                               Release 8.0.19

     Release date: 2008-11-03

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.18. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.19

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a
       localized error message (Tom)
       We have addressed similar issues before, but it would still fail if
       the "character has no equivalent" message itself couldn't be
       converted. The fix is to disable localization and send the plain
       ASCII error message when we detect such a situation.
     * Fix possible crash when deeply nested functions are invoked from a
       trigger (Tom)
     * Ensure an error is reported when a newly-defined PL/pgSQL trigger
       function is invoked as a normal function (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect tsearch2 headline generation when single query item
       matches first word of text (Sushant Sinha)
     * Fix improper display of fractional seconds in interval values when
       using a non-ISO datestyle in an "--enable-integer-datetimes" build
       (Ron Mayer)
     * Ensure SPI_getvalue and SPI_getbinval behave correctly when the
       passed tuple and tuple descriptor have different numbers of columns
       (Tom)
       This situation is normal when a table has had columns added or
       removed, but these two functions didn't handle it properly. The
       only likely consequence is an incorrect error indication.
     * Fix ecpg's parsing of "CREATE USER" (Michael)
     * Fix recent breakage of pg_ctl restart (Tom)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008i (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Brazil, Mauritius, Syria)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.0.18

     Release date: 2008-09-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.17. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.18

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Widen local lock counters from 32 to 64 bits (Tom)
       This responds to reports that the counters could overflow in
       sufficiently long transactions, leading to unexpected "lock is
       already held" errors.
     * Add checks in executor startup to ensure that the tuples produced
       by an "INSERT" or "UPDATE" will match the target table's current
       rowtype (Tom)
       "ALTER COLUMN TYPE", followed by re-use of a previously cached
       plan, could produce this type of situation. The check protects
       against data corruption and/or crashes that could ensue.
     * Fix datetime input functions to correctly detect integer overflow
       when running on a 64-bit platform (Tom)
     * Improve performance of writing very long log messages to syslog
       (Tom)
     * Fix bug in backwards scanning of a cursor on a SELECT DISTINCT ON
       query (Tom)
     * Fix planner to estimate that GROUP BY expressions yielding boolean
       results always result in two groups, regardless of the expressions'
       contents (Tom)
       This is very substantially more accurate than the regular GROUP BY
       estimate for certain boolean tests like "col" IS NULL.
     * Fix PL/Tcl to behave correctly with Tcl 8.5, and to be more careful
       about the encoding of data sent to or from Tcl (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Python to work with Python 2.5
       This is a back-port of fixes made during the 8.2 development cycle.
     * Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's error reporting after failure to
       send a SQL command (Tom)
     * Fix pg_ctl to properly preserve postmaster command-line arguments
       across a restart (Bruce)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008f (for DST law
       changes in Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Mauritius, Morocco,
       Pakistan, Palestine, and Paraguay)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.0.17

     Release date: 2008-06-12

   This release contains one serious bug fix over 8.0.16. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.17

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Make pg_get_ruledef() parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
       Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be
       dumped as, say, -42::integer, which is subtly incorrect: it should
       be (-42)::integer due to operator precedence rules. Usually this
       would make little difference, but it could interact with another
       recent patch to cause PostgreSQL to reject what had been a valid
       "SELECT DISTINCT" view query. Since this could result in pg_dump
       output failing to reload, it is being treated as a high-priority
       fix. The only released versions in which dump output is actually
       incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.0.16

     Release date: never released

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.15. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.16

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ... PRIMARY KEY" so that the new column
       is correctly checked to see if it's been initialized to all
       non-nulls (Brendan Jurd)
       Previous versions neglected to check this requirement at all.
     * Fix possible "CREATE TABLE" failure when inheriting the "same"
       constraint from multiple parent relations that inherited that
       constraint from a common ancestor (Tom)
     * Fix conversions between ISO-8859-5 and other encodings to handle
       Cyrillic "Yo" characters (e and E with two dots) (Sergey Burladyan)
     * Fix a few datatype input functions that were allowing unused bytes
       in their results to contain uninitialized, unpredictable values
       (Tom)
       This could lead to failures in which two apparently identical
       literal values were not seen as equal, resulting in the parser
       complaining about unmatched ORDER BY and DISTINCT expressions.
     * Fix a corner case in regular-expression substring matching
       (substring(string from pattern)) (Tom)
       The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
       the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
       subexpression hasn't got a match. An example is substring('foo'
       from 'foo(bar)?'). This should return NULL, since (bar) isn't
       matched, but it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match
       instead (ie, foo).
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2008c (for DST law
       changes in Morocco, Iraq, Choibalsan, Pakistan, Syria, Cuba,
       Argentina/San_Luis, and Chile)
     * Fix incorrect result from ecpg's PGTYPEStimestamp_sub() function
       (Michael)
     * Fix core dump in "contrib/xml2"'s xpath_table() function when the
       input query returns a NULL value (Tom)
     * Fix "contrib/xml2"'s makefile to not override CFLAGS (Tom)
     * Fix DatumGetBool macro to not fail with gcc 4.3 (Tom)
       This problem affects "old style" (V0) C functions that return
       boolean. The fix is already in 8.3, but the need to back-patch it
       was not realized at the time.
     * Fix longstanding "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" race condition (Tom)
       In rare cases a session that had just executed a "LISTEN" might not
       get a notification, even though one would be expected because the
       concurrent transaction executing "NOTIFY" was observed to commit
       later.
       A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed a
       not-yet-committed "LISTEN" command will not see any row in
       pg_listener for the "LISTEN", should it choose to look; formerly it
       would have. This behavior was never documented one way or the
       other, but it is possible that some applications depend on the old
       behavior.
     * Fix rare crash when an error occurs during a query using a hash
       index (Heikki)
     * Fix input of datetime values for February 29 in years BC (Tom)
       The former coding was mistaken about which years were leap years.
     * Fix "unrecognized node type" error in some variants of "ALTER
       OWNER" (Tom)
     * Fix pg_ctl to correctly extract the postmaster's port number from
       command-line options (Itagaki Takahiro, Tom)
       Previously, pg_ctl start -w could try to contact the postmaster on
       the wrong port, leading to bogus reports of startup failure.
     * Use "-fwrapv" to defend against possible misoptimization in recent
       gcc versions (Tom)
       This is known to be necessary when building PostgreSQL with gcc 4.3
       or later.
     * Fix display of constant expressions in ORDER BY and GROUP BY (Tom)
       An explictly casted constant would be shown incorrectly. This could
       for example lead to corruption of a view definition during dump and
       reload.
     * Fix libpq to handle NOTICE messages correctly during COPY OUT (Tom)
       This failure has only been observed to occur when a user-defined
       datatype's output routine issues a NOTICE, but there is no
       guarantee it couldn't happen due to other causes.

                               Release 8.0.15

     Release date: 2008-01-07

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.14, including fixes
   for significant security issues. For information about new features in
   the 8.0 major release, see the Section called Release 8.0.

   This is the last 8.0.X release for which the PostgreSQL community will
   produce binary packages for Windows. Windows users are encouraged to
   move to 8.2.X or later, since there are Windows-specific fixes in 8.2.X
   that are impractical to back-port. 8.0.X will continue to be supported
   on other platforms.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.15

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
       the user running "VACUUM", "ANALYZE", etc (Tom)
       Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates
       are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been
       understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if
       one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that
       triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of
       risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will
       be executed by routine maintenance operations such as "VACUUM
       FULL", which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser
       account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with
       superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition
       and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for
       standard maintenance operations (including "VACUUM", "ANALYZE",
       "REINDEX", and "CLUSTER") to execute as the table owner rather than
       the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism
       already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing
       this security measure, execution of "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" and
       "SET ROLE" is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.
       (CVE-2007-6600)
     * Repair assorted bugs in the regular-expression package (Tom, Will
       Drewry)
       Suitably crafted regular-expression patterns could cause crashes,
       infinite or near-infinite looping, and/or massive memory
       consumption, all of which pose denial-of-service hazards for
       applications that accept regex search patterns from untrustworthy
       sources. (CVE-2007-4769, CVE-2007-4772, CVE-2007-6067)
     * Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
       password authentication, as a security measure (Joe)
       The fix that appeared for this in 8.0.14 was incomplete, as it
       plugged the hole for only some "dblink" functions. (CVE-2007-6601,
       CVE-2007-3278)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2007k (in particular,
       recent Argentina changes) (Tom)
     * Fix planner failure in some cases of WHERE false AND var IN (SELECT
       ...) (Tom)
     * Preserve the tablespace of indexes that are rebuilt by "ALTER TABLE
       ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE" (Tom)
     * Make archive recovery always start a new WAL timeline, rather than
       only when a recovery stop time was used (Simon)
       This avoids a corner-case risk of trying to overwrite an existing
       archived copy of the last WAL segment, and seems simpler and
       cleaner than the original definition.
     * Make "VACUUM" not use all of maintenance_work_mem when the table is
       too small for it to be useful (Alvaro)
     * Fix potential crash in translate() when using a multibyte database
       encoding (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Perl to cope when platform's Perl defines type bool as int
       rather than char (Tom)
       While this could theoretically happen anywhere, no standard build
       of Perl did things this way ... until Mac OS X 10.5.
     * Fix PL/Python to not crash on long exception messages (Alvaro)
     * Fix pg_dump to correctly handle inheritance child tables that have
       default expressions different from their parent's (Tom)
     * ecpg parser fixes (Michael)
     * Make "contrib/tablefunc"'s crosstab() handle NULL rowid as a
       category in its own right, rather than crashing (Joe)
     * Fix tsvector and tsquery output routines to escape backslashes
       correctly (Teodor, Bruce)
     * Fix crash of to_tsvector() on huge input strings (Teodor)
     * Require a specific version of Autoconf to be used when
       re-generating the "configure" script (Peter)
       This affects developers and packagers only. The change was made to
       prevent accidental use of untested combinations of Autoconf and
       PostgreSQL versions. You can remove the version check if you really
       want to use a different Autoconf version, but it's your
       responsibility whether the result works or not.

Changes

     * Prevent index corruption when a transaction inserts rows and then
       aborts close to the end of a concurrent "VACUUM" on the same table
       (Tom)
     * Make "CREATE DOMAIN ... DEFAULT NULL" work properly (Tom)
     * Fix excessive logging of SSL error messages (Tom)
     * Fix logging so that log messages are never interleaved when using
       the syslogger process (Andrew)

       upcoming changes (Tom)
     * Windows socket improvements (Magnus)
     * Suppress timezone name (%Z) in log timestamps on Windows because of
       possible encoding mismatches (Tom)

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Support explicit placement of the temporary-table schema within
       search_path, and disable searching it for functions and operators
       (Tom)
       This is needed to allow a security-definer function to set a truly
       secure value of search_path. Without it, an unprivileged SQL user
       can use temporary objects to execute code with the privileges of
       the security-definer function (CVE-2007-2138). See "CREATE
       FUNCTION" for more information.
     * "/contrib/tsearch2" crash fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix potential-data-corruption bug in how "VACUUM FULL" handles
       "UPDATE" chains (Tom, Pavan Deolasee)
     * Fix PANIC during enlargement of a hash index (bug introduced in
       8.0.10) (Tom)

   features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.12

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Remove overly-restrictive check for type length in constraints and
       functional indexes(Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 8.0.11

     Release date: 2007-02-05

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.10, including a
   security fix. For information about new features in the 8.0 major
   release, see the Section called Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.11

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Remove security vulnerabilities that allowed connected users to
       read backend memory (Tom)
       The vulnerabilities involve suppressing the normal check that a SQL
       function returns the data type it's declared to, and changing the
       data type of a table column (CVE-2007-0555, CVE-2007-0556). These
       errors can easily be exploited to cause a backend crash, and in
       principle might be used to read database content that the user
       should not be able to access.
     * Fix rare bug wherein btree index page splits could fail due to
       choosing an infeasible split point (Heikki Linnakangas)
     * Fix for rare Assert() crash triggered by UNION (Tom)
     * Tighten security of multi-byte character processing for UTF8
       sequences over three bytes long (Tom)

                               Release 8.0.10

     Release date: 2007-01-08

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.9. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called

Migration to Version 8.0.10

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Improve handling of getaddrinfo() on AIX (Tom)
       This fixes a problem with starting the statistics collector, among
       other things.
     * Fix "failed to re-find parent key" errors in "VACUUM" (Tom)
     * Fix race condition for truncation of a large relation across a
       gigabyte boundary by "VACUUM" (Tom)
     * Fix bugs affecting multi-gigabyte hash indexes (Tom)

     * Fix error when constructing an ARRAY[] made up of multiple empty
       elements (Tom)
     * Fix ecpg memory leak during connection (Michael)
     * to_number() and to_char(numeric) are now STABLE, not IMMUTABLE, for
       new initdb installs (Tom)
       This is because lc_numeric can potentially change the output of
       these functions.
     * Improve index usage of regular expressions that use parentheses
       (Tom)
       This improves psql \d performance also.
     * Update timezone database
       This affects Australian and Canadian daylight-savings rules in
       particular.

                                Release 8.0.8

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.7, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues. For information about new
   features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 might require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       might require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote
       is in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations and standard_conforming_strings
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also
       future-proofs them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard
       string literal syntax. Applications that use multiple PostgreSQL
       connections concurrently should migrate to PQescapeStringConn() and
       PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that escaping is done correctly for
       the settings in use in each database connection. Applications that
       do string escaping "by hand" should be modified to rely on library
       routines instead.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, alt_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Fix bug that sometimes caused OR'd index scans to miss rows they
       should have returned
     * Fix WAL replay for case where a btree index has been truncated
     * Fix SIMILAR TO for patterns involving | (Tom)
     * Fix "SELECT INTO" and "CREATE TABLE AS" to create tables in the
       default tablespace, not the base directory (Kris Jurka)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Fix for Bonjour on Intel Macs (Ashley Clark)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks
     * Fix problem with password prompting on some Win32 systems (Robert
       Kinberg)

                                Release 8.0.7

     Release date: 2006-02-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.6. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix potential crash in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" (CVE-2006-0553)
       An unprivileged user could crash the server process, resulting in
       momentary denial of service to other users, if the server has been
       compiled with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to
       Akio Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 8.0.4, 7.4.9, and 7.3.11 releases.
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog and pg_subtrans file creation (Tom)
     * Fix cases that could lead to crashes if a cache-invalidation
       message arrives at just the wrong time (Tom)
     * Properly check DOMAIN constraints for UNKNOWN parameters in
       prepared statements (Neil)
     * Ensure "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" will process FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and
       PRIMARY KEY constraints in the proper order (Nakano Yoshihisa)
     * Fixes to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators or operator classes (Tom)
     * Allow pg_restore to continue properly after a "COPY" failure;
       formerly it tried to treat the remaining "COPY" data as SQL
       commands (Stephen Frost)
     * Fix pg_ctl unregister crash when the data directory is not
       specified (Magnus)
     * Fix ecpg crash on AMD64 and PPC (Neil)
     * Recover properly if error occurs during argument passing in
       PL/python (Neil)
     * Fix PL/perl's handling of locales on Win32 to match the backend
       (Andrew)
     * Fix crash when log_min_messages is set to DEBUG3 or above in
       "postgresql.conf" on Win32 (Bruce)
     * Fix pgxs -L library path specification for Win32, Cygwin, OS X, AIX
       (Bruce)
     * Check that SID is enabled while checking for Win32 admin privileges
       (Magnus)
     * Properly reject out-of-range date inputs (Kris Jurka)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.6

     Release date: 2006-01-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.5. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.3, see the release notes
   for 8.0.3. Also, you might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns
   after updating, if you are affected by the locale or plperl issues
   described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix Windows code so that postmaster will continue rather than exit
       if there is no more room in ShmemBackendArray (Magnus)
       The previous behavior could lead to a denial-of-service situation
       if too many connection requests arrive close together. This applies
       *only* to the Windows port.
     * Fix bug introduced in 8.0 that could allow ReadBuffer to return an
       already-used page as new, potentially causing loss of
       recently-committed data (Tom)
     * Fix for protocol-level Describe messages issued outside a
       transaction or in a failed transaction (Tom)
     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You might need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Allow more flexible relocation of installation directories (Tom)
       Previous releases supported relocation only if all installation
       directory paths were the same except for the last component.
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Various fixes for functions returning RECORDs (Tom)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.5

     Release date: 2005-12-12

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.4. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.3, see the release notes
   for 8.0.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix race condition in transaction log management
       There was a narrow window in which an I/O operation could be
       initiated for the wrong page, leading to an Assert failure or data
       corruption.
     * Fix bgwriter problems after recovering from errors (Tom)
       The background writer was found to leak buffer pins after write
       errors. While not fatal in itself, this might lead to mysterious
       blockages of later VACUUM commands.
     * Prevent failure if client sends Bind protocol message when current
       transaction is already aborted
     * "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * AIX and HPUX compile fixes (Tom)
     * Retry file reads and writes after Windows NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES error
       (Qingqing Zhou)
     * Fix intermittent failure when log_line_prefix includes %i
     * Fix psql performance issue with long scripts on Windows (Merlin
       Moncure)
     * Fix missing updates of "pg_group" flat file
     * Fix longstanding planning error for outer joins
       This bug sometimes caused a bogus error "RIGHT JOIN is only
       supported with merge-joinable join conditions".
     * Postpone timezone initialization until after "postmaster.pid" is
       created
       This avoids confusing startup scripts that expect the pid file to
       appear quickly.
     * Prevent core dump in pg_autovacuum when a table has been dropped
     * Fix problems with whole-row references (foo.*) to subquery results
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.4

     Release date: 2005-10-04

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.3. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.3, see the release notes
   for 8.0.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix error that allowed "VACUUM" to remove ctid chains too soon, and
       add more checking in code that follows ctid links
       This fixes a long-standing problem that could cause crashes in very
       rare circumstances.
     * Fix CHAR() to properly pad spaces to the specified length when
       using a multiple-byte character set (Yoshiyuki Asaba)
       In prior releases, the padding of CHAR() was incorrect because it
       only padded to the specified number of bytes without considering
       how many characters were stored.
     * Force a checkpoint before committing "CREATE DATABASE"
       This should fix recent reports of "index is not a btree" failures
       when a crash occurs shortly after "CREATE DATABASE".
     * Fix the sense of the test for read-only transaction in "COPY"
       The code formerly prohibited "COPY TO", where it should prohibit
       "COPY FROM".
     * Handle consecutive embedded newlines in "COPY" CSV-mode input
     * Fix date_trunc(week) for dates near year end
     * Fix planning problem with outer-join ON clauses that reference only
       the inner-side relation
     * Further fixes for x FULL JOIN y ON true corner cases
     * Fix overenthusiastic optimization of x IN (SELECT DISTINCT ...) and
       related cases
     * Fix mis-planning of queries with small LIMIT values due to poorly
       thought out "fuzzy" cost comparison
     * Make array_in and array_recv more paranoid about validating their
       OID parameter
     * Fix missing rows in queries like UPDATE a=... WHERE a... with GiST
       index on column a
     * Improve robustness of datetime parsing
     * Improve checking for partially-written WAL pages
     * Improve robustness of signal handling when SSL is enabled
     * Improve MIPS and M68K spinlock code
     * Don't try to open more than max_files_per_process files during
       postmaster startup
     * Various memory leakage fixes
     * Various portability improvements
     * Update timezone data files
     * Improve handling of DLL load failures on Windows
     * Improve random-number generation on Windows
     * Make psql -f filename return a nonzero exit code when opening the
       file fails
     * Change pg_dump to handle inherited check constraints more reliably
     * Fix password prompting in pg_restore on Windows
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to handle var := var correctly when the variable is of
       pass-by-reference type
     * Fix PL/Perl %_SHARED so it's actually shared
     * Fix "contrib/pg_autovacuum" to allow sleep intervals over 2000 sec
     * Update "contrib/tsearch2" to use current Snowball code
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.3

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.2, including several
   security-related issues. For information about new features in the 8.0
   major release, see the Section called Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.3

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, it is
   one possible way of handling two significant security problems that
   have been found in the initial contents of 8.0.X system catalogs. A
   dump/initdb/reload sequence using 8.0.3's initdb will automatically
   correct these problems.

   The larger security problem is that the built-in character set encoding
   conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged
   users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not
   secure against malicious choices of arguments. The fix involves
   changing the declared parameter list of these functions so that they
   can no longer be invoked from SQL commands. (This does not affect their
   normal use by the encoding conversion machinery.)

   The lesser problem is that the "contrib/tsearch2" module creates
   several functions that are improperly declared to return internal when
   they do not accept internal arguments. This breaks type safety for all
   functions using internal arguments.

   It is strongly recommended that all installations repair these errors,
   either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedure given
   below. The errors at least allow unprivileged database users to crash
   their server process, and might allow unprivileged users to gain the
   privileges of a database superuser.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the same manual repair
   procedures shown in the 7.4.8 release notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change encoding function signature to prevent misuse
     * Change "contrib/tsearch2" to avoid unsafe use of INTERNAL function
       results
     * Guard against incorrect second parameter to record_out
     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix comparisons of TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
       The comparison code was wrong in the case where the
       --enable-integer-datetimes configuration switch had been used.
       NOTE: if you have an index on a TIME WITH TIME ZONE column, it will
       need to be "REINDEX"ed after installing this update, because the
       fix corrects the sort order of column values.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Fix mis-display of negative fractional seconds in INTERVAL values
       This error only occurred when the --enable-integer-datetimes
       configuration switch had been used.
     * Fix pg_dump to dump trigger names containing % correctly (Neil)
     * Still more 64-bit fixes for "contrib/intagg"
     * Prevent incorrect optimization of functions returning RECORD
     * Prevent crash on COALESCE(NULL,NULL)
     * Fix Borland makefile for libpq
     * Fix "contrib/btree_gist" for timetz type (Teodor)
     * Make "pg_ctl" check the PID found in "postmaster.pid" to see if it
       is still a live process
     * Fix "pg_dump"/"pg_restore" problems caused by addition of dump
       timestamps
     * Fix interaction between materializing holdable cursors and firing
       deferred triggers during transaction commit
     * Fix memory leak in SQL functions returning pass-by-reference data
       types

                                Release 8.0.2

     Release date: 2005-04-07

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.1. For information
   about new features in the 8.0 major release, see the Section called
   Release 8.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.*. This release
   updates the major version number of the PostgreSQL libraries, so it
   might be necessary to re-link some user applications if they cannot
   find the properly-numbered shared library.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Increment the major version number of all interface libraries
       (Bruce)
       This should have been done in 8.0.0. It is required so 7.4.X
       versions of PostgreSQL client applications, like psql, can be used
       on the same machine as 8.0.X applications. This might require
       re-linking user applications that use these libraries.
     * Add Windows-only wal_sync_method setting of "fsync_writethrough"
       (Magnus, Bruce)
       This setting causes PostgreSQL to write through any disk-drive
       write cache when writing to WAL. This behavior was formerly called
       "fsync", but was renamed because it acts quite differently from
       "fsync" on other platforms.
     * Enable the wal_sync_method setting of "open_datasync" on Windows,
       and make it the default for that platform (Magnus, Bruce)
       Because the default is no longer "fsync_writethrough", data loss is
       possible during a power failure if the disk drive has write caching
       enabled. To turn off the write cache on Windows, from the Device
       Manager, choose the drive properties, then Policies.
     * New cache management algorithm 2Q replaces ARC (Tom)
       This was done to avoid a pending US patent on ARC. The 2Q code
       might be a few percentage points slower than ARC for some work
       loads. A better cache management algorithm will appear in 8.1.
     * Planner adjustments to improve behavior on freshly-created tables
       (Tom)
     * Allow plpgsql to assign to an element of an array that is initially
       NULL (Tom)
       Formerly the array would remain NULL, but now it becomes a
       single-element array. The main SQL engine was changed to handle
       "UPDATE" of a null array value this way in 8.0, but the similar
       case in plpgsql was overlooked.
     * Convert \r\n and \r to \n in plpython function bodies (Michael
       Fuhr)
       This prevents syntax errors when plpython code is written on a
       Windows or Mac client.
     * Allow SPI cursors to handle utility commands that return rows, such
       as "EXPLAIN" (Tom)
     * Fix "CLUSTER" failure after "ALTER TABLE SET WITHOUT OIDS" (Tom)
     * Reduce memory usage of "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN" (Neil)
     * Fix "ALTER LANGUAGE RENAME" (Tom)
     * Document the Windows-only register and unregister options of pg_ctl
       (Magnus)
     * Ensure operations done during backend shutdown are counted by
       statistics collector
       This is expected to resolve reports of pg_autovacuum not vacuuming
       the system catalogs often enough -- it was not being told about
       catalog deletions caused by temporary table removal during backend
       exit.
     * Change the Windows default for configuration parameter
       log_destination to "eventlog" (Magnus)
       By default, a server running on Windows will now send log output to
       the Windows event logger rather than standard error.
     * Make Kerberos authentication work on Windows (Magnus)
     * Allow "ALTER DATABASE RENAME" by superusers who aren't flagged as
       having CREATEDB privilege (Tom)
     * Modify WAL log entries for "CREATE" and "DROP DATABASE" to not
       specify absolute paths (Tom)
       This allows point-in-time recovery on a different machine with
       possibly different database location. Note that "CREATE TABLESPACE"
       still poses a hazard in such situations.
     * Fix crash from a backend exiting with an open transaction that
       created a table and opened a cursor on it (Tom)
     * Fix array_map() so it can call PL functions (Tom)
     * Several "contrib/tsearch2" and "contrib/btree_gist" fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix crash of some "contrib/pgcrypto" functions on some platforms
       (Marko Kreen)
     * Fix "contrib/intagg" for 64-bit platforms (Tom)
     * Fix ecpg bugs in parsing of "CREATE" statement (Michael)
     * Work around gcc bug on powerpc and amd64 causing problems in ecpg
       (Christof Petig)
     * Do not use locale-aware versions of upper(), lower(), and initcap()
       when the locale is C (Bruce)
       This allows these functions to work on platforms that generate
       errors for non-7-bit data when the locale is C.
     * Fix quote_ident() to quote names that match keywords (Tom)
     * Fix to_date() to behave reasonably when CC and YY fields are both
       used (Karel)
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from failing when given a zero-month
       interval (Tom)
     * Fix wrong week returned by date_trunc('week') (Bruce)
       date_trunc('week') returned the wrong year for the first few days
       of January in some years.
     * Use the correct default mask length for class D addresses in INET
       data types (Tom)

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Check that creator of an aggregate function has the right to
       execute the specified transition functions
       This oversight made it possible to bypass denial of EXECUTE
       permission on a function.
     * Fix security and 64-bit issues in contrib/intagg
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Make "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN" enforce domain constraints in all
       cases
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Improve planning of grouped aggregate queries
     * "ROLLBACK TO savepoint" closes cursors created since the savepoint
     * Fix inadequate backend stack size on Windows
     * Avoid SHGetSpecialFolderPath() on Windows (Magnus)
     * Fix some problems in running pg_autovacuum as a Windows service
       (Dave Page)
     * Multiple minor bug fixes in pg_dump/pg_restore
     * Fix ecpg segfault with named structs used in typedefs (Michael)

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   Microsoft Windows Native Server
          This is the first PostgreSQL release to run natively on
          Microsoft Windows as a server. It can run as a Windows service.
          This release supports NT-based Windows releases like Windows
          2000 SP4, Windows XP, and Windows 2003. Older releases like
          Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME are not supported because
          these operating systems do not have the infrastructure to
          support PostgreSQL. A separate installer project has been
          created to ease installation on Windows -- see
          http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/win32/.

          Although tested throughout our release cycle, the Windows port
          does not have the benefit of years of use in production
          environments that PostgreSQL has on Unix platforms. Therefore it
          should be treated with the same level of caution as you would a
          new product.

          Previous releases required the Unix emulation toolkit Cygwin in
          order to run the server on Windows operating systems. PostgreSQL
          has supported native clients on Windows for many years.

   Savepoints
          Savepoints allow specific parts of a transaction to be aborted
          without affecting the remainder of the transaction. Prior
          releases had no such capability; there was no way to recover
          from a statement failure within a transaction except by aborting
          the whole transaction. This feature is valuable for application
          writers who require error recovery within a complex transaction.

   Point-In-Time Recovery
          In previous releases there was no way to recover from disk drive
          failure except to restore from a previous backup or use a
          standby replication server. Point-in-time recovery allows
          continuous backup of the server. You can recover either to the
          point of failure or to some transaction in the past.

   Tablespaces
          Tablespaces allow administrators to select different file
          systems for storage of individual tables, indexes, and
          databases. This improves performance and control over disk space
          usage. Prior releases used initlocation and manual symlink
          management for such tasks.

   Improved Buffer Management, CHECKPOINT, VACUUM
          This release has a more intelligent buffer replacement strategy,
          which will make better use of available shared buffers and
          improve performance. The performance impact of vacuum and
          checkpoints is also lessened.

   Change Column Types
          A column's data type can now be changed with "ALTER TABLE".

   New Perl Server-Side Language
          A new version of the plperl server-side language now supports a
          persistent shared storage area, triggers, returning records and
          arrays of records, and SPI calls to access the database.

   Comma-separated-value (CSV) support in COPY
          "COPY" can now read and write comma-separated-value files. It
          has the flexibility to interpret nonstandard quoting and
          separation characters too.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 8.0

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * In "READ COMMITTED" serialization mode, volatile functions now see
       the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the
       beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to
       the beginning of the interactive command that called the function.
     * Functions declared "STABLE" or "IMMUTABLE" always use the snapshot
       of the calling query, and therefore do not see the effects of
       actions taken after the calling query starts, whether in their own
       transaction or other transactions. Such a function must be
       read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other
       than "SELECT".
     * Nondeferred "AFTER" triggers are now fired immediately after
       completion of the triggering query, rather than upon finishing the
       current interactive command. This makes a difference when the
       triggering query occurred within a function: the trigger is invoked
       before the function proceeds to its next operation.
     * Server configuration parameters virtual_host and tcpip_socket have
       been replaced with a more general parameter listen_addresses. Also,
       the server now listens on localhost by default, which eliminates
       the need for the -i postmaster switch in many scenarios.
     * Server configuration parameters SortMem and VacuumMem have been
       renamed to work_mem and maintenance_work_mem to better reflect
       their use. The original names are still supported in "SET" and
       "SHOW".
     * Server configuration parameters log_pid, log_timestamp, and
       log_source_port have been replaced with a more general parameter
       log_line_prefix.
     * Server configuration parameter syslog has been replaced with a more
       logical log_destination variable to control the log output
       destination.
     * Server configuration parameter log_statement has been changed so it
       can selectively log just database modification or data definition
       statements. Server configuration parameter log_duration now prints
       only when log_statement prints the query.
     * Server configuration parameter max_expr_depth parameter has been
       replaced with max_stack_depth which measures the physical stack
       size rather than the expression nesting depth. This helps prevent
       session termination due to stack overflow caused by recursive
       functions.
     * The length() function no longer counts trailing spaces in CHAR(n)
       values.
     * Casting an integer to BIT(N) selects the rightmost N bits of the
       integer, not the leftmost N bits as before.
     * Updating an element or slice of a NULL array value now produces a
       nonnull array result, namely an array containing just the
       assigned-to positions.
     * Syntax checking of array input values has been tightened up
       considerably. Junk that was previously allowed in odd places with
       odd results now causes an error. Empty-string element values must
       now be written as "", rather than writing nothing. Also changed
       behavior with respect to whitespace surrounding array elements:
       trailing whitespace is now ignored, for symmetry with leading
       whitespace (which has always been ignored).
     * Overflow in integer arithmetic operations is now detected and
       reported as an error.
     * The arithmetic operators associated with the single-byte "char"
       data type have been removed.
     * The extract() function (also called date_part) now returns the
       proper year for BC dates. It previously returned one less than the
       correct year. The function now also returns the proper values for
       millennium and century.
     * CIDR values now must have their nonmasked bits be zero. For
       example, we no longer allow 204.248.199.1/31 as a CIDR value. Such
       values should never have been accepted by PostgreSQL and will now
       be rejected.
     * "EXECUTE" now returns a completion tag that matches the executed
       statement.
     * psql's "\copy" command now reads or writes to the query's
       stdin/stdout, rather than psql's stdin/stdout. The previous
       behavior can be accessed via new "pstdin"/"pstdout" parameters.
     * The JDBC client interface has been removed from the core
       distribution, and is now hosted at http://jdbc.postgresql.org.
     * The Tcl client interface has also been removed. There are several
       Tcl interfaces now hosted at http://gborg.postgresql.org.
     * The server now uses its own time zone database, rather than the one
       supplied by the operating system. This will provide consistent
       behavior across all platforms. In most cases, there should be
       little noticeable difference in time zone behavior, except that the
       time zone names used by "SET"/"SHOW" TimeZone might be different
       from what your platform provides.
     * Configure's threading option no longer requires users to run tests
       or edit configuration files; threading options are now detected
       automatically.
     * Now that tablespaces have been implemented, initlocation has been
       removed.
     * The API for user-defined GiST indexes has been changed. The Union
       and PickSplit methods are now passed a pointer to a special
       GistEntryVector structure, rather than a bytea.
     __________________________________________________________________

Deprecated Features

   Some aspects of PostgreSQL's behavior have been determined to be
   suboptimal. For the sake of backward compatibility these have not been
   removed in 8.0, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed
   in the next major release.

     * The 8.1 release will remove the to_char() function for intervals.
     * The server now warns of empty strings passed to oid/float4/float8
       data types, but continues to interpret them as zeroes as before. In
       the next major release, empty strings will be considered invalid
       input for these data types.
     * By default, tables in PostgreSQL 8.0 and earlier are created with
       OIDs. In the next release, this will *not* be the case: to create a
       table that contains OIDs, the "WITH OIDS" clause must be specified
       or the default_with_oids configuration parameter must be set. Users
       are encouraged to explicitly specify "WITH OIDS" if their tables
       require OIDs for compatibility with future releases of PostgreSQL.

Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the changes between release
   8.0 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance Improvements

     * Support cross-data-type index usage (Tom)
       Before this change, many queries would not use an index if the data
       types did not match exactly. This improvement makes index usage
       more intuitive and consistent.
     * New buffer replacement strategy that improves caching (Jan)
       Prior releases used a least-recently-used (LRU) cache to keep
       recently referenced pages in memory. The LRU algorithm did not
       consider the number of times a specific cache entry was accessed,
       so large table scans could force out useful cache pages. The new
       cache algorithm uses four separate lists to track most recently
       used and most frequently used cache pages and dynamically optimize
       their replacement based on the work load. This should lead to much
       more efficient use of the shared buffer cache. Administrators who
       have tested shared buffer sizes in the past should retest with this
       new cache replacement policy.
     * Add subprocess to write dirty buffers periodically to reduce
       checkpoint writes (Jan)
       In previous releases, the checkpoint process, which runs every few
       minutes, would write all dirty buffers to the operating system's
       buffer cache then flush all dirty operating system buffers to disk.
       This resulted in a periodic spike in disk usage that often hurt
       performance. The new code uses a background writer to trickle disk
       writes at a steady pace so checkpoints have far fewer dirty pages
       to write to disk. Also, the new code does not issue a global sync()
       call, but instead fsync()s just the files written since the last
       checkpoint. This should improve performance and minimize
       degradation during checkpoints.
     * Add ability to prolong vacuum to reduce performance impact (Jan)
       On busy systems, "VACUUM" performs many I/O requests which can hurt
       performance for other users. This release allows you to slow down
       "VACUUM" to reduce its impact on other users, though this increases
       the total duration of "VACUUM".
     * Improve B-tree index performance for duplicate keys (Dmitry Tkach,
       Tom)
       This improves the way indexes are scanned when many duplicate
       values exist in the index.
     * Use dynamically-generated table size estimates while planning (Tom)
       Formerly the planner estimated table sizes using the values seen by
       the last "VACUUM" or "ANALYZE", both as to physical table size
       (number of pages) and number of rows. Now, the current physical
       table size is obtained from the kernel, and the number of rows is
       estimated by multiplying the table size by the row density (rows
       per page) seen by the last "VACUUM" or "ANALYZE". This should
       produce more reliable estimates in cases where the table size has
       changed significantly since the last housekeeping command.
     * Improved index usage with OR clauses (Tom)
       This allows the optimizer to use indexes in statements with many OR
       clauses that would not have been indexed in the past. It can also
       use multi-column indexes where the first column is specified and
       the second column is part of an OR clause.
     * Improve matching of partial index clauses (Tom)
       The server is now smarter about using partial indexes in queries
       involving complex "WHERE" clauses.
     * Improve performance of the GEQO optimizer (Tom)
       The GEQO optimizer is used to plan queries involving many tables
       (by default, twelve or more). This release speeds up the way
       queries are analyzed to decrease time spent in optimization.
     * Miscellaneous optimizer improvements
       There is not room here to list all the minor improvements made, but
       numerous special cases work better than in prior releases.
     * Improve lookup speed for C functions (Tom)
       This release uses a hash table to lookup information for
       dynamically loaded C functions. This improves their speed so they
       perform nearly as quickly as functions that are built into the
       server executable.
     * Add type-specific "ANALYZE" statistics capability (Mark
       Cave-Ayland)
       This feature allows more flexibility in generating statistics for
       nonstandard data types.
     * "ANALYZE" now collects statistics for expression indexes (Tom)
       Expression indexes (also called functional indexes) allow users to
       index not just columns but the results of expressions and function
       calls. With this release, the optimizer can gather and use
       statistics about the contents of expression indexes. This will
       greatly improve the quality of planning for queries in which an
       expression index is relevant.
     * New two-stage sampling method for "ANALYZE" (Manfred Koizar)
       This gives better statistics when the density of valid rows is very
       different in different regions of a table.
     * Speed up "TRUNCATE" (Tom)
       This buys back some of the performance loss observed in 7.4, while
       still keeping "TRUNCATE" transaction-safe.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Changes

     * Add WAL file archiving and point-in-time recovery (Simon Riggs)
     * Add tablespaces so admins can control disk layout (Gavin)
     * Add a built-in log rotation program (Andreas Pflug)
       It is now possible to log server messages conveniently without
       relying on either syslog or an external log rotation program.
     * Add new read-only server configuration parameters to show server
       compile-time settings: block_size, integer_datetimes,
       max_function_args, max_identifier_length, max_index_keys (Joe)
     * Make quoting of sameuser, samegroup, and all remove special meaning
       of these terms in "pg_hba.conf" (Andrew)
     * Use clearer IPv6 name ::1/128 for localhost in default
       "pg_hba.conf" (Andrew)
     * Use CIDR format in "pg_hba.conf" examples (Andrew)
     * Rename server configuration parameters SortMem and VacuumMem to
       work_mem and maintenance_work_mem (Old names still supported) (Tom)
       This change was made to clarify that bulk operations such as index
       and foreign key creation use maintenance_work_mem, while work_mem
       is for workspaces used during query execution.
     * Allow logging of session disconnections using server configuration
       log_disconnections (Andrew)
     * Add new server configuration parameter log_line_prefix to allow
       control of information emitted in each log line (Andrew)
       Available information includes user name, database name, remote IP
       address, and session start time.
     * Remove server configuration parameters log_pid, log_timestamp,
       log_source_port; functionality superseded by log_line_prefix
       (Andrew)
     * Replace the virtual_host and tcpip_socket parameters with a unified
       listen_addresses parameter (Andrew, Tom)
       virtual_host could only specify a single IP address to listen on.
       listen_addresses allows multiple addresses to be specified.
     * Listen on localhost by default, which eliminates the need for the
       "-i" postmaster switch in many scenarios (Andrew)
       Listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) opens no new security holes but
       allows configurations like Windows and JDBC, which do not support
       local sockets, to work without special adjustments.
     * Remove syslog server configuration parameter, and add more logical
       log_destination variable to control log output location (Magnus)
     * Change server configuration parameter log_statement to take values
       all, mod, ddl, or none to select which queries are logged (Bruce)
       This allows administrators to log only data definition changes or
       only data modification statements.
     * Some logging-related configuration parameters could formerly be
       adjusted by ordinary users, but only in the "more verbose"
       direction. They are now treated more strictly: only superusers can
       set them. However, a superuser can use "ALTER USER" to provide
       per-user settings of these values for non-superusers. Also, it is
       now possible for superusers to set values of superuser-only
       configuration parameters via PGOPTIONS.
     * Allow configuration files to be placed outside the data directory
       (mlw)
       By default, configuration files are kept in the cluster's top
       directory. With this addition, configuration files can be placed
       outside the data directory, easing administration.
     * Plan prepared queries only when first executed so constants can be
       used for statistics (Oliver Jowett)
       Prepared statements plan queries once and execute them many times.
       While prepared queries avoid the overhead of re-planning on each
       use, the quality of the plan suffers from not knowing the exact
       parameters to be used in the query. In this release, planning of
       unnamed prepared statements is delayed until the first execution,
       and the actual parameter values of that execution are used as
       optimization hints. This allows use of out-of-line parameter
       passing without incurring a performance penalty.
     * Allow "DECLARE CURSOR" to take parameters (Oliver Jowett)
       It is now useful to issue "DECLARE CURSOR" in a Parse message with
       parameters. The parameter values sent at Bind time will be
       substituted into the execution of the cursor's query.
     * Fix hash joins and aggregates of inet and cidr data types (Tom)
       Release 7.4 handled hashing of mixed inet and cidr values
       incorrectly. (This bug did not exist in prior releases because they
       wouldn't try to hash either data type.)
     * Make log_duration print only when log_statement prints the query
       (Ed L.)
     __________________________________________________________________

Query Changes

     * Add savepoints (nested transactions) (Alvaro)
     * Unsupported isolation levels are now accepted and promoted to the
       nearest supported level (Peter)
       The SQL specification states that if a database doesn't support a
       specific isolation level, it should use the next more restrictive
       level. This change complies with that recommendation.
     * Allow "BEGIN WORK" to specify transaction isolation levels like
       "START TRANSACTION" does (Bruce)
     * Fix table permission checking for cases in which rules generate a
       query type different from the originally submitted query (Tom)
     * Implement dollar quoting to simplify single-quote usage (Andrew,
       Tom, David Fetter)
       In previous releases, because single quotes had to be used to quote
       a function's body, the use of single quotes inside the function
       text required use of two single quotes or other error-prone
       notations. With this release we add the ability to use "dollar
       quoting" to quote a block of text. The ability to use different
       quoting delimiters at different nesting levels greatly simplifies
       the task of quoting correctly, especially in complex functions.
       Dollar quoting can be used anywhere quoted text is needed.
     * Make CASE val WHEN compval1 THEN ... evaluate val only once (Tom)
       "CASE" no longer evaluates the tested expression multiple times.
       This has benefits when the expression is complex or is volatile.
     * Test "HAVING" before computing target list of an aggregate query
       (Tom)
       Fixes improper failure of cases such as SELECT SUM(win)/SUM(lose)
       ... GROUP BY ... HAVING SUM(lose) > 0. This should work but
       formerly could fail with divide-by-zero.
     * Replace max_expr_depth parameter with max_stack_depth parameter,
       measured in kilobytes of stack size (Tom)
       This gives us a fairly bulletproof defense against crashing due to
       runaway recursive functions. Instead of measuring the depth of
       expression nesting, we now directly measure the size of the
       execution stack.
     * Allow arbitrary row expressions (Tom)
       This release allows SQL expressions to contain arbitrary composite
       types, that is, row values. It also allows functions to more easily
       take rows as arguments and return row values.
     * Allow "LIKE"/"ILIKE" to be used as the operator in row and
       subselect comparisons (Fabien Coelho)
     * Avoid locale-specific case conversion of basic ASCII letters in
       identifiers and keywords (Tom)
       This solves the "Turkish problem" with mangling of words containing
       I and i. Folding of characters outside the 7-bit-ASCII set is still
       locale-aware.
     * Improve syntax error reporting (Fabien, Tom)
       Syntax error reports are more useful than before.
     * Change "EXECUTE" to return a completion tag matching the executed
       statement (Kris Jurka)
       Previous releases return an "EXECUTE" tag for any "EXECUTE" call.
       In this release, the tag returned will reflect the command
       executed.
     * Avoid emitting "NATURAL CROSS JOIN" in rule listings (Tom)
       Such a clause makes no logical sense, but in some cases the rule
       decompiler formerly produced this syntax.
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation Changes

     * Add "COMMENT ON" for casts, conversions, languages, operator
       classes, and large objects (Christopher)
     * Add new server configuration parameter default_with_oids to control
       whether tables are created with OIDs by default (Neil)
       This allows administrators to control whether "CREATE TABLE"
       commands create tables with or without OID columns by default.
       (Note: the current factory default setting for default_with_oids is
       TRUE, but the default will become FALSE in future releases.)
     * Add "WITH" / "WITHOUT OIDS" clause to "CREATE TABLE AS" (Neil)
     * Allow "ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN" to drop an OID column ("ALTER TABLE
       SET WITHOUT OIDS" still works) (Tom)
     * Allow composite types as table columns (Tom)
     * Allow "ALTER ... ADD COLUMN" with defaults and "NOT NULL"
       constraints; works per SQL spec (Rod)
       It is now possible for "ADD COLUMN" to create a column that is not
       initially filled with NULLs, but with a specified default value.
     * Add "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" to change column's type (Rod)
       It is now possible to alter a column's data type without dropping
       and re-adding the column.
     * Allow multiple "ALTER" actions in a single "ALTER TABLE" command
       (Rod)
       This is particularly useful for "ALTER" commands that rewrite the
       table (which include "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" and "ADD COLUMN" with a
       default). By grouping "ALTER" commands together, the table need be
       rewritten only once.
     * Allow "ALTER TABLE" to add SERIAL columns (Tom)
       This falls out from the new capability of specifying defaults for
       new columns.
     * Allow changing the owners of aggregates, conversions, databases,
       functions, operators, operator classes, schemas, types, and
       tablespaces (Christopher, Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
       Previously this required modifying the system tables directly.
     * Allow temporary object creation to be limited to "SECURITY DEFINER"
       functions (Sean Chittenden)
     * Add "ALTER TABLE ... SET WITHOUT CLUSTER" (Christopher)
       Prior to this release, there was no way to clear an auto-cluster
       specification except to modify the system tables.
     * Constraint/Index/SERIAL names are now "table_column_type" with
       numbers appended to guarantee uniqueness within the schema (Tom)
       The SQL specification states that such names should be unique
       within a schema.
     * Add pg_get_serial_sequence() to return a SERIAL column's sequence
       name (Christopher)
       This allows automated scripts to reliably find the SERIAL sequence
       name.
     * Warn when primary/foreign key data type mismatch requires costly
       lookup
     * New "ALTER INDEX" command to allow moving of indexes between
       tablespaces (Gavin)
     * Make "ALTER TABLE OWNER" change dependent sequence ownership too
       (Alvaro)
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Command Changes

     * Allow "CREATE SCHEMA" to create triggers, indexes, and sequences
       (Neil)
     * Add "ALSO" keyword to "CREATE RULE" (Fabien Coelho)
       This allows "ALSO" to be added to rule creation to contrast it with
       "INSTEAD" rules.
     * Add "NOWAIT" option to "LOCK" (Tatsuo)
       This allows the "LOCK" command to fail if it would have to wait for
       the requested lock.
     * Allow "COPY" to read and write comma-separated-value (CSV) files
       (Andrew, Bruce)
     * Generate error if the "COPY" delimiter and NULL string conflict
       (Bruce)
     * "GRANT"/"REVOKE" behavior follows the SQL spec more closely
     * Avoid locking conflict between "CREATE INDEX" and "CHECKPOINT"
       (Tom)
       In 7.3 and 7.4, a long-running B-tree index build could block
       concurrent "CHECKPOINT"s from completing, thereby causing WAL bloat
       because the WAL log could not be recycled.
     * Database-wide "ANALYZE" does not hold locks across tables (Tom)
       This reduces the potential for deadlocks against other backends
       that want exclusive locks on tables. To get the benefit of this
       change, do not execute database-wide "ANALYZE" inside a transaction
       block ("BEGIN" block); it must be able to commit and start a new
       transaction for each table.
     * "REINDEX" does not exclusively lock the index's parent table
       anymore
       The index itself is still exclusively locked, but readers of the
       table can continue if they are not using the particular index being
       rebuilt.
     * Erase MD5 user passwords when a user is renamed (Bruce)
       PostgreSQL uses the user name as salt when encrypting passwords via
       MD5. When a user's name is changed, the salt will no longer match
       the stored MD5 password, so the stored password becomes useless. In
       this release a notice is generated and the password is cleared. A
       new password must then be assigned if the user is to be able to log
       in with a password.
     * New pg_ctl "kill" option for Windows (Andrew)
       Windows does not have a kill command to send signals to backends so
       this capability was added to pg_ctl.
     * Information schema improvements
     * Add "--pwfile" option to initdb so the initial password can be set
       by GUI tools (Magnus)
     * Detect locale/encoding mismatch in initdb (Peter)
     * Add "register" command to pg_ctl to register Windows operating
       system service (Dave Page)
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Type and Function Changes

     * More complete support for composite types (row types) (Tom)
       Composite values can be used in many places where only scalar
       values worked before.
     * Reject nonrectangular array values as erroneous (Joe)
       Formerly, array_in would silently build a surprising result.
     * Overflow in integer arithmetic operations is now detected (Tom)
     * The arithmetic operators associated with the single-byte "char"
       data type have been removed.
       Formerly, the parser would select these operators in many
       situations where an "unable to select an operator" error would be
       more appropriate, such as null * null. If you actually want to do
       arithmetic on a "char" column, you can cast it to integer
       explicitly.
     * Syntax checking of array input values considerably tightened up
       (Joe)
       Junk that was previously allowed in odd places with odd results now
       causes an ERROR, for example, non-whitespace after the closing
       right brace.
     * Empty-string array element values must now be written as "", rather
       than writing nothing (Joe)
       Formerly, both ways of writing an empty-string element value were
       allowed, but now a quoted empty string is required. The case where
       nothing at all appears will probably be considered to be a NULL
       element value in some future release.
     * Array element trailing whitespace is now ignored (Joe)
       Formerly leading whitespace was ignored, but trailing whitespace
       between an element value and the delimiter or right brace was
       significant. Now trailing whitespace is also ignored.
     * Emit array values with explicit array bounds when lower bound is
       not one (Joe)
     * Accept YYYY-monthname-DD as a date string (Tom)
     * Make netmask and hostmask functions return maximum-length mask
       length (Tom)
     * Change factorial function to return numeric (Gavin)
       Returning numeric allows the factorial function to work for a wider
       range of input values.
     * to_char/to_date() date conversion improvements (Kurt Roeckx, Fabien
       Coelho)
     * Make length() disregard trailing spaces in CHAR(n) (Gavin)
       This change was made to improve consistency: trailing spaces are
       semantically insignificant in CHAR(n) data, so they should not be
       counted by length().
     * Warn about empty string being passed to OID/float4/float8 data
       types (Neil)
       8.1 will throw an error instead.
     * Allow leading or trailing whitespace in
       int2/int4/int8/float4/float8 input routines (Neil)
     * Better support for IEEE Infinity and NaN values in float4/float8
       (Neil)
       These should now work on all platforms that support IEEE-compliant
       floating point arithmetic.
     * Add "week" option to date_trunc() (Robert Creager)
     * Fix to_char for 1 BC (previously it returned 1 AD) (Bruce)
     * Fix date_part(year) for BC dates (previously it returned one less
       than the correct year) (Bruce)
     * Fix date_part() to return the proper millennium and century (Fabien
       Coelho)
       In previous versions, the century and millennium results had a
       wrong number and started in the wrong year, as compared to standard
       reckoning of such things.
     * Add ceiling() as an alias for ceil(), and power() as an alias for
       pow() for standards compliance (Neil)
     * Change ln(), log(), power(), and sqrt() to emit the correct
       SQLSTATE error codes for certain error conditions, as specified by
       SQL:2003 (Neil)
     * Add width_bucket() function as defined by SQL:2003 (Neil)
     * Add generate_series() functions to simplify working with numeric
       sets (Joe)
     * Fix upper/lower/initcap() functions to work with multibyte
       encodings (Tom)
     * Add boolean and bitwise integer "AND"/"OR" aggregates (Fabien
       Coelho)
     * New session information functions to return network addresses for
       client and server (Sean Chittenden)
     * Add function to determine the area of a closed path (Sean
       Chittenden)
     * Add function to send cancel request to other backends (Magnus)
     * Add interval plus datetime operators (Tom)
       The reverse ordering, datetime plus interval, was already
       supported, but both are required by the SQL standard.
     * Casting an integer to BIT(N) selects the rightmost N bits of the
       integer (Tom)
       In prior releases, the leftmost N bits were selected, but this was
       deemed unhelpful, not to mention inconsistent with casting from bit
       to int.
     * Require CIDR values to have all nonmasked bits be zero (Kevin
       Brintnall)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server-Side Language Changes

     * In READ COMMITTED serialization mode, volatile functions now see
       the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the
       beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to
       the beginning of the interactive command that called the function.
     * Functions declared STABLE or IMMUTABLE always use the snapshot of
       the calling query, and therefore do not see the effects of actions
       taken after the calling query starts, whether in their own
       transaction or other transactions. Such a function must be
       read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other
       than "SELECT". There is a considerable performance gain from
       declaring a function STABLE or IMMUTABLE rather than VOLATILE.
     * Nondeferred "AFTER" triggers are now fired immediately after
       completion of the triggering query, rather than upon finishing the
       current interactive command. This makes a difference when the
       triggering query occurred within a function: the trigger is invoked
       before the function proceeds to its next operation. For example, if
       a function inserts a new row into a table, any nondeferred foreign
       key checks occur before proceeding with the function.
     * Allow function parameters to be declared with names (Dennis
       Bjrklund)
       This allows better documentation of functions. Whether the names
       actually do anything depends on the specific function language
       being used.
     * Allow PL/pgSQL parameter names to be referenced in the function
       (Dennis Bjrklund)
       This basically creates an automatic alias for each named parameter.
     * Do minimal syntax checking of PL/pgSQL functions at creation time
       (Tom)
       This allows us to catch simple syntax errors sooner.
     * More support for composite types (row and record variables) in
       PL/pgSQL
       For example, it now works to pass a rowtype variable to another
       function as a single variable.
     * Default values for PL/pgSQL variables can now reference previously
       declared variables
     * Improve parsing of PL/pgSQL FOR loops (Tom)
       Parsing is now driven by presence of ".." rather than data type of
       "FOR" variable. This makes no difference for correct functions, but
       should result in more understandable error messages when a mistake
       is made.
     * Major overhaul of PL/Perl server-side language (Command Prompt,
       Andrew Dunstan)
     * In PL/Tcl, SPI commands are now run in subtransactions. If an error
       occurs, the subtransaction is cleaned up and the error is reported
       as an ordinary Tcl error, which can be trapped with catch.
       Formerly, it was not possible to catch such errors.
     * Accept "ELSEIF" in PL/pgSQL (Neil)
       Previously PL/pgSQL only allowed "ELSIF", but many people are
       accustomed to spelling this keyword "ELSEIF".
     __________________________________________________________________

psql Changes

     * Improve psql information display about database objects
       (Christopher)
     * Allow psql to display group membership in "\du" and "\dg" (Markus
       Bertheau)
     * Prevent psql "\dn" from showing temporary schemas (Bruce)
     * Allow psql to handle tilde user expansion for file names (Zach
       Irmen)
     * Allow psql to display fancy prompts, including color, via readline
       (Reece Hart, Chet Ramey)
     * Make psql "\copy" match "COPY" command syntax fully (Tom)
     * Show the location of syntax errors (Fabien Coelho, Tom)
     * Add "CLUSTER" information to psql "\d" display (Bruce)
     * Change psql "\copy stdin/stdout" to read from command input/output
       (Bruce)
     * Add "pstdin"/"pstdout" to read from psql's stdin/stdout (Mark Feit)
     * Add global psql configuration file, "psqlrc.sample" (Bruce)
       This allows a central file where global psql startup commands can
       be stored.
     * Have psql "\d+" indicate if the table has an OID column (Neil)
     * On Windows, use binary mode in psql when reading files so control-Z
       is not seen as end-of-file
     * Have "\dn+" show permissions and description for schemas (Dennis
       Bjrklund)
     * Improve tab completion support (Stefan Kaltenbrunn, Greg Sabino
       Mullane)
     * Allow boolean settings to be set using upper or lower case (Michael
       Paesold)
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump Changes

     * Use dependency information to improve the reliability of pg_dump
       (Tom)
       This should solve the longstanding problems with related objects
       sometimes being dumped in the wrong order.
     * Have pg_dump output objects in alphabetical order if possible (Tom)
       This should make it easier to identify changes between dump files.
     * Allow pg_restore to ignore some SQL errors (Fabien Coelho)
       This makes pg_restore's behavior similar to the results of feeding
       a pg_dump output script to psql. In most cases, ignoring errors and
       plowing ahead is the most useful thing to do. Also added was a
       pg_restore option to give the old behavior of exiting on an error.
     * pg_restore "-l" display now includes objects' schema names
     * New begin/end markers in pg_dump text output (Bruce)
     * Add start/stop times for pg_dump/pg_dumpall in verbose mode (Bruce)
     * Allow most pg_dump options in pg_dumpall (Christopher)
     * Have pg_dump use "ALTER OWNER" rather than "SET SESSION
       AUTHORIZATION" by default (Christopher)
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq Changes

     * Make libpq's "SIGPIPE" handling thread-safe (Bruce)
     * Add PQmbdsplen() which returns the display length of a character
       (Tatsuo)
     * Add thread locking to SSL and Kerberos connections (Manfred Spraul)
     * Allow PQoidValue(), PQcmdTuples(), and PQoidStatus() to work on
       "EXECUTE" commands (Neil)
     * Add PQserverVersion() to provide more convenient access to the
       server version number (Greg Sabino Mullane)
     * Add PQprepare/PQsendPrepared() functions to support preparing
       statements without necessarily specifying the data types of their
       parameters (Abhijit Menon-Sen)
     * Many ECPG improvements, including "SET DESCRIPTOR" (Michael)
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code Changes

     * Allow the database server to run natively on Windows (Claudio,
       Magnus, Andrew)
     * Shell script commands converted to C versions for Windows support
       (Andrew)
     * Create an extension makefile framework (Fabien Coelho, Peter)
       This simplifies the task of building extensions outside the
       original source tree.
     * Support relocatable installations (Bruce)
       Directory paths for installed files (such as the "/share"
       directory) are now computed relative to the actual location of the
       executables, so that an installation tree can be moved to another
       place without reconfiguring and rebuilding.
     * Use "--with-docdir" to choose installation location of
       documentation; also allow "--infodir" (Peter)
     * Add "--without-docdir" to prevent installation of documentation
       (Peter)
     * Upgrade to DocBook V4.2 SGML (Peter)
     * New PostgreSQL CVS tag (Marc)
       This was done to make it easier for organizations to manage their
       own copies of the PostgreSQL CVS repository. File version stamps
       from the master repository will not get munged by checking into or
       out of a copied repository.
     * Clarify locking code (Manfred Koizar)
     * Buffer manager cleanup (Neil)
     * Decouple platform tests from CPU spinlock code (Bruce, Tom)
     * Add inlined test-and-set code on PA-RISC for gcc (ViSolve, Tom)
     * Improve i386 spinlock code (Manfred Spraul)
     * Clean up spinlock assembly code to avoid warnings from newer gcc
       releases (Tom)
     * Remove JDBC from source tree; now a separate project
     * Remove the libpgtcl client interface; now a separate project
     * More accurately estimate memory and file descriptor usage (Tom)
     * Improvements to the Mac OS X startup scripts (Ray A.)
     * New fsync() test program (Bruce)
     * Major documentation improvements (Neil, Peter)
     * Remove pg_encoding; not needed anymore
     * Remove pg_id; not needed anymore
     * Remove initlocation; not needed anymore
     * Auto-detect thread flags (no more manual testing) (Bruce)
     * Use Olson's public domain timezone library (Magnus)
     * With threading enabled, use thread flags on Unixware for backend
       executables too (Bruce)
       Unixware cannot mix threaded and nonthreaded object files in the
       same executable, so everything must be compiled as threaded.
     * psql now uses a flex-generated lexical analyzer to process command
       strings
     * Reimplement the linked list data structure used throughout the
       backend (Neil)
       This improves performance by allowing list append and length
       operations to be more efficient.
     * Allow dynamically loaded modules to create their own server
       configuration parameters (Thomas Hallgren)
     * New Brazilian version of FAQ (Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     * Add French FAQ (Guillaume Lelarge)
     * New pgevent for Windows logging
     * Make libpq and ECPG build as proper shared libraries on OS X (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib Changes

     * Overhaul of "contrib/dblink" (Joe)
     * "contrib/dbmirror" improvements (Steven Singer)
     * New "contrib/xml2" (John Gray, Torchbox)
     * Updated "contrib/mysql"
     * New version of "contrib/btree_gist" (Teodor)
     * New "contrib/trgm", trigram matching for PostgreSQL (Teodor)
     * Many "contrib/tsearch2" improvements (Teodor)
     * Add double metaphone to "contrib/fuzzystrmatch" (Andrew)
     * Allow "contrib/pg_autovacuum" to run as a Windows service (Dave
       Page)
     * Add functions to "contrib/dbsize" (Andreas Pflug)
     * Removed "contrib/pg_logger": obsoleted by integrated logging
       subprocess
     * Removed "contrib/rserv": obsoleted by various separate projects

Changes

     * Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
       changing session-local state (Gurjeet Singh, Tom)
       This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions from
       possibly subverting a superuser's session (CVE-2009-4136).
     * Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
       common name (CN) field (Magnus)
       This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a server or
       client name during SSL validation (CVE-2009-4034).
     * Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization
       (Tom)
     * Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)
       This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's
       already committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
       if a plain VACUUM is interrupted after having truncated the table.
     * Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
       calculation (Tom)
       This could occur with extremely large planner estimates for the
       size of a hashjoin's result.
     * Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons (Chris Mikkelson)
     * Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)
       The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
       Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
       domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
       was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
       stack would pass to it.
     * Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
       connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
       libpq versions (Tom)

                               Release 7.4.26

     Release date: 2009-09-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.25. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.26

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   have any hash indexes on interval columns, you must "REINDEX" them
   after updating to 7.4.26. Also, if you are upgrading from a version
   earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)
       This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch that
       disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
       security-definer functions. (See CVE-2007-6600)
     * Fix handling of sub-SELECTs appearing in the arguments of an
       outer-level aggregate function (Tom)
     * Fix hash calculation for data type interval (Tom)
       This corrects wrong results for hash joins on interval values. It
       also changes the contents of hash indexes on interval columns. If
       you have any such indexes, you must "REINDEX" them after updating.
     * Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
       and integer datetimes are in use (Alex Hunsaker)
     * Fix calculation of distance between a point and a line segment
       (Tom)
       This led to incorrect results from a number of geometric operators.
     * Fix money data type to work in locales where currency amounts have
       no fractional digits, e.g. Japan (Itagaki Takahiro)
     * Properly round datetime input like
       00:12:57.9999999999999999999999999999 (Tom)
     * Fix poor choice of page split point in GiST R-tree operator classes
       (Teodor)
     * Fix portability issues in plperl initialization (Andrew Dunstan)
     * Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
       "COPY FROM STDIN" (Tom)
     * Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
       both libraries are installed (Zdenek Kotala)

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.24. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.25

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails
       (Tom)
       This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
       related failure scenarios. The previous fixes were narrowly
       tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now
       recognized that *any* error thrown by an encoding conversion
       function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying
       to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable
       translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form
       of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive
       error reporting situation. (CVE-2009-0922)
     * Disallow "CREATE CONVERSION" with the wrong encodings for the
       specified conversion function (Heikki)
       This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion
       failure. The previous change is a backstop to guard against other
       kinds of failures in the same area.
     * Fix core dump when to_char() is given format codes that are
       inappropriate for the type of the data argument (Tom)
     * Add MUST (Mauritius Island Summer Time) to the default list of
       known timezone abbreviations (Xavier Bugaud)

Changes

     * Improve handling of URLs in headline() function (Teodor)
     * Improve handling of overlength headlines in headline() function
       (Teodor)
     * Prevent possible Assert failure or misconversion if an encoding
       conversion is created with the wrong conversion function for the
       specified pair of encodings (Tom, Heikki)
     * Avoid unnecessary locking of small tables in "VACUUM" (Heikki)
     * Fix uninitialized variables in "contrib/tsearch2"'s get_covers()
       function (Teodor)
     * Fix bug in to_char()'s handling of TH format codes (Andreas
       Scherbaum)
     * Make all documentation reference pgsql-bugs and/or pgsql-hackers as
       appropriate, instead of the now-decommissioned pgsql-ports and
       pgsql-patches mailing lists (Tom)

                               Release 7.4.23

     Release date: 2008-11-03

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.22. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.23

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a
       localized error message (Tom)
       We have addressed similar issues before, but it would still fail if
       the "character has no equivalent" message itself couldn't be
       converted. The fix is to disable localization and send the plain
       ASCII error message when we detect such a situation.
     * Fix incorrect tsearch2 headline generation when single query item
       matches first word of text (Sushant Sinha)
     * Fix improper display of fractional seconds in interval values when
       using a non-ISO datestyle in an "--enable-integer-datetimes" build
       (Ron Mayer)
     * Ensure SPI_getvalue and SPI_getbinval behave correctly when the
       passed tuple and tuple descriptor have different numbers of columns
       (Tom)
       This situation is normal when a table has had columns added or
       removed, but these two functions didn't handle it properly. The
       only likely consequence is an incorrect error indication.
     * Fix ecpg's parsing of "CREATE USER" (Michael)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.4.22

     Release date: 2008-09-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.21. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.22

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix datetime input functions to correctly detect integer overflow
       when running on a 64-bit platform (Tom)
     * Improve performance of writing very long log messages to syslog
       (Tom)
     * Fix bug in backwards scanning of a cursor on a SELECT DISTINCT ON
       query (Tom)
     * Fix planner to estimate that GROUP BY expressions yielding boolean
       results always result in two groups, regardless of the expressions'
       contents (Tom)
       This is very substantially more accurate than the regular GROUP BY
       estimate for certain boolean tests like "col" IS NULL.
     * Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's error reporting after failure to
       send a SQL command (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.4.21

     Release date: 2008-06-12

   This release contains one serious bug fix over 7.4.20. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.21

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Make pg_get_ruledef() parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
       Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be
       dumped as, say, -42::integer, which is subtly incorrect: it should
       be (-42)::integer due to operator precedence rules. Usually this
       would make little difference, but it could interact with another
       recent patch to cause PostgreSQL to reject what had been a valid
       "SELECT DISTINCT" view query. Since this could result in pg_dump
       output failing to reload, it is being treated as a high-priority
       fix. The only released versions in which dump output is actually
       incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.4.20

     Release date: never released

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.19. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.20

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix conversions between ISO-8859-5 and other encodings to handle
       Cyrillic "Yo" characters (e and E with two dots) (Sergey Burladyan)
     * Fix a few datatype input functions that were allowing unused bytes
       in their results to contain uninitialized, unpredictable values
       (Tom)
       This could lead to failures in which two apparently identical
       literal values were not seen as equal, resulting in the parser
       complaining about unmatched ORDER BY and DISTINCT expressions.
     * Fix a corner case in regular-expression substring matching
       (substring(string from pattern)) (Tom)
       The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
       the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
       subexpression hasn't got a match. An example is substring('foo'
       from 'foo(bar)?'). This should return NULL, since (bar) isn't
       matched, but it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match
       instead (ie, foo).
     * Fix incorrect result from ecpg's PGTYPEStimestamp_sub() function
       (Michael)
     * Fix DatumGetBool macro to not fail with gcc 4.3 (Tom)
       This problem affects "old style" (V0) C functions that return
       boolean. The fix is already in 8.3, but the need to back-patch it
       was not realized at the time.
     * Fix longstanding "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" race condition (Tom)
       In rare cases a session that had just executed a "LISTEN" might not
       get a notification, even though one would be expected because the
       concurrent transaction executing "NOTIFY" was observed to commit
       later.
       A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed a
       not-yet-committed "LISTEN" command will not see any row in
       pg_listener for the "LISTEN", should it choose to look; formerly it
       would have. This behavior was never documented one way or the
       other, but it is possible that some applications depend on the old
       behavior.
     * Fix display of constant expressions in ORDER BY and GROUP BY (Tom)
       An explictly casted constant would be shown incorrectly. This could
       for example lead to corruption of a view definition during dump and
       reload.
     * Fix libpq to handle NOTICE messages correctly during COPY OUT (Tom)
       This failure has only been observed to occur when a user-defined
       datatype's output routine issues a NOTICE, but there is no
       guarantee it couldn't happen due to other causes.

                               Release 7.4.19

     Release date: 2008-01-07

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.18, including fixes
   for significant security issues. For information about new features in
   the 7.4 major release, see the Section called Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.19

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
       the user running "VACUUM", "ANALYZE", etc (Tom)
       Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates
       are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been
       understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if
       one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that
       triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of
       risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will
       be executed by routine maintenance operations such as "VACUUM
       FULL", which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser
       account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with
       superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition
       and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for
       standard maintenance operations (including "VACUUM", "ANALYZE",
       "REINDEX", and "CLUSTER") to execute as the table owner rather than
       the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism
       already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing
       this security measure, execution of "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" and
       "SET ROLE" is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.
       (CVE-2007-6600)
     * Repair assorted bugs in the regular-expression package (Tom, Will
       Drewry)
       Suitably crafted regular-expression patterns could cause crashes,
       infinite or near-infinite looping, and/or massive memory
       consumption, all of which pose denial-of-service hazards for
       applications that accept regex search patterns from untrustworthy
       sources. (CVE-2007-4769, CVE-2007-4772, CVE-2007-6067)
     * Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
       password authentication, as a security measure (Joe)
       The fix that appeared for this in 7.4.18 was incomplete, as it
       plugged the hole for only some "dblink" functions. (CVE-2007-6601,
       CVE-2007-3278)
     * Fix planner failure in some cases of WHERE false AND var IN (SELECT
       ...) (Tom)
     * Fix potential crash in translate() when using a multibyte database
       encoding (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Python to not crash on long exception messages (Alvaro)
     * ecpg parser fixes (Michael)
     * Make "contrib/tablefunc"'s crosstab() handle NULL rowid as a
       category in its own right, rather than crashing (Joe)
     * Fix tsvector and tsquery output routines to escape backslashes
       correctly (Teodor, Bruce)
     * Fix crash of to_tsvector() on huge input strings (Teodor)
     * Require a specific version of Autoconf to be used when
       re-generating the "configure" script (Peter)
       This affects developers and packagers only. The change was made to
       prevent accidental use of untested combinations of Autoconf and
       PostgreSQL versions. You can remove the version check if you really
       want to use a different Autoconf version, but it's your
       responsibility whether the result works or not.

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Support explicit placement of the temporary-table schema within
       search_path, and disable searching it for functions and operators
       (Tom)
       This is needed to allow a security-definer function to set a truly
       secure value of search_path. Without it, an unprivileged SQL user
       can use temporary objects to execute code with the privileges of
       the security-definer function (CVE-2007-2138). See "CREATE
       FUNCTION" for more information.
     * "/contrib/tsearch2" crash fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix potential-data-corruption bug in how "VACUUM FULL" handles
       "UPDATE" chains (Tom, Pavan Deolasee)
     * Fix PANIC during enlargement of a hash index (bug introduced in
       7.4.15) (Tom)

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Remove security vulnerability that allowed connected users to read
       backend memory (Tom)
       The vulnerability involves suppressing the normal check that a SQL
       function returns the data type it's declared to, or changing the
       data type of a table column used in a SQL function (CVE-2007-0555).
       This error can easily be exploited to cause a backend crash, and in
       principle might be used to read database content that the user
       should not be able to access.
     * Fix rare bug wherein btree index page splits could fail due to
       choosing an infeasible split point (Heikki Linnakangas)
     * Fix for rare Assert() crash triggered by UNION (Tom)
     * Tighten security of multi-byte character processing for UTF8
       sequences over three bytes long (Tom)

       elements (Tom)
     * to_number() and to_char(numeric) are now STABLE, not IMMUTABLE, for
       new initdb installs (Tom)
       This is because lc_numeric can potentially change the output of
       these functions.
     * Improve index usage of regular expressions that use parentheses
       (Tom)
       This improves psql \d performance also.

                               Release 7.4.13

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.12, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues. For information about new
   features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.13

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 might require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       might require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote
       is in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations and standard_conforming_strings
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also
       future-proofs them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard
       string literal syntax. Applications that use multiple PostgreSQL
       connections concurrently should migrate to PQescapeStringConn() and
       PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that escaping is done correctly for
       the settings in use in each database connection. Applications that
       do string escaping "by hand" should be modified to rely on library
       routines instead.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, alt_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Fix bug that sometimes caused OR'd index scans to miss rows they
       should have returned
     * Fix WAL replay for case where a btree index has been truncated
     * Fix SIMILAR TO for patterns involving | (Tom)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Fix for Bonjour on Intel Macs (Ashley Clark)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix potential crash in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" (CVE-2006-0553)
       An unprivileged user could crash the server process, resulting in
       momentary denial of service to other users, if the server has been
       compiled with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to
       Akio Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 7.4.9 and 7.3.11 releases.
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog file creation (Tom)
     * Properly check DOMAIN constraints for UNKNOWN parameters in
       prepared statements (Neil)
     * Fix to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators (Tom)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)

Migration to Version 7.4.11

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.8, see the release notes
   for 7.4.8. Also, you might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns
   after updating, if you are affected by the locale or plperl issues
   described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix for protocol-level Describe messages issued outside a
       transaction or in a failed transaction (Tom)
     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You might need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix race condition in transaction log management
       There was a narrow window in which an I/O operation could be
       initiated for the wrong page, leading to an Assert failure or data
       corruption.
     * Prevent failure if client sends Bind protocol message when current
       transaction is already aborted
     * "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * AIX and HPUX compile fixes (Tom)
     * Fix longstanding planning error for outer joins
       This bug sometimes caused a bogus error "RIGHT JOIN is only
       supported with merge-joinable join conditions".
     * Prevent core dump in pg_autovacuum when a table has been dropped

Migration to Version 7.4.9

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.8, see the release notes
   for 7.4.8.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix error that allowed "VACUUM" to remove ctid chains too soon, and
       add more checking in code that follows ctid links
       This fixes a long-standing problem that could cause crashes in very
       rare circumstances.
     * Fix CHAR() to properly pad spaces to the specified length when
       using a multiple-byte character set (Yoshiyuki Asaba)
       In prior releases, the padding of CHAR() was incorrect because it
       only padded to the specified number of bytes without considering
       how many characters were stored.
     * Fix the sense of the test for read-only transaction in "COPY"
       The code formerly prohibited "COPY TO", where it should prohibit
       "COPY FROM".
     * Fix planning problem with outer-join ON clauses that reference only
       the inner-side relation
     * Further fixes for x FULL JOIN y ON true corner cases
     * Make array_in and array_recv more paranoid about validating their
       OID parameter
     * Fix missing rows in queries like UPDATE a=... WHERE a... with GiST
       index on column a
     * Improve robustness of datetime parsing
     * Improve checking for partially-written WAL pages
     * Improve robustness of signal handling when SSL is enabled
     * Don't try to open more than max_files_per_process files during
       postmaster startup
     * Various memory leakage fixes
     * Various portability improvements
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to handle var := var correctly when the variable is of
       pass-by-reference type
     * Update "contrib/tsearch2" to use current Snowball code
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.4.8

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.7, including several
   security-related issues. For information about new features in the 7.4
   major release, see the Section called Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, it is
   one possible way of handling two significant security problems that
   have been found in the initial contents of 7.4.X system catalogs. A
   dump/initdb/reload sequence using 7.4.8's initdb will automatically
   correct these problems.

   The larger security problem is that the built-in character set encoding
   conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged
   users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not
   secure against malicious choices of arguments. The fix involves
   changing the declared parameter list of these functions so that they
   can no longer be invoked from SQL commands. (This does not affect their
   normal use by the encoding conversion machinery.)

   The lesser problem is that the "contrib/tsearch2" module creates
   several functions that are misdeclared to return internal when they do
   not accept internal arguments. This breaks type safety for all
   functions using internal arguments.

   It is strongly recommended that all installations repair these errors,
   either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedures given
   below. The errors at least allow unprivileged database users to crash
   their server process, and might allow unprivileged users to gain the
   privileges of a database superuser.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the following procedures
   instead. As the database superuser, do:
BEGIN;
UPDATE pg_proc SET proargtypes[3] = 'internal'::regtype
WHERE pronamespace = 11 AND pronargs = 5
     AND proargtypes[2] = 'cstring'::regtype;
-- The command should report having updated 90 rows;
-- if not, rollback and investigate instead of committing!
COMMIT;

   Next, if you have installed "contrib/tsearch2", do:
BEGIN;
UPDATE pg_proc SET proargtypes[0] = 'internal'::regtype
WHERE oid IN (
   'dex_init(text)'::regprocedure,
   'snb_en_init(text)'::regprocedure,
   'snb_ru_init(text)'::regprocedure,
   'spell_init(text)'::regprocedure,
   'syn_init(text)'::regprocedure
);
-- The command should report having updated 5 rows;
-- if not, rollback and investigate instead of committing!
COMMIT;

   If this command fails with a message like "function "dex_init(text)"
   does not exist", then either "tsearch2" is not installed in this
   database, or you already did the update.

   The above procedures must be carried out in *each* database of an
   installation, including template1, and ideally including template0 as
   well. If you do not fix the template databases then any subsequently
   created databases will contain the same errors. template1 can be fixed
   in the same way as any other database, but fixing template0 requires
   additional steps. First, from any database issue:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';

   Next connect to template0 and perform the above repair procedures.
   Finally, do:
-- re-freeze template0:
VACUUM FREEZE;
-- and protect it against future alterations:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change encoding function signature to prevent misuse
     * Change "contrib/tsearch2" to avoid unsafe use of INTERNAL function
       results
     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix comparisons of TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
       The comparison code was wrong in the case where the
       --enable-integer-datetimes configuration switch had been used.
       NOTE: if you have an index on a TIME WITH TIME ZONE column, it will
       need to be "REINDEX"ed after installing this update, because the
       fix corrects the sort order of column values.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Fix mis-display of negative fractional seconds in INTERVAL values
       This error only occurred when the --enable-integer-datetimes
       configuration switch had been used.
     * Ensure operations done during backend shutdown are counted by
       statistics collector
       This is expected to resolve reports of pg_autovacuum not vacuuming
       the system catalogs often enough -- it was not being told about
       catalog deletions caused by temporary table removal during backend
       exit.
     * Additional buffer overrun checks in plpgsql (Neil)
     * Fix pg_dump to dump trigger names containing % correctly (Neil)
     * Fix "contrib/pgcrypto" for newer OpenSSL builds (Marko Kreen)
     * Still more 64-bit fixes for "contrib/intagg"
     * Prevent incorrect optimization of functions returning RECORD
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from dumping core for month-related
       formats
     * Prevent crash on COALESCE(NULL,NULL)
     * Fix array_map to call PL functions correctly
     * Fix permission checking in "ALTER DATABASE RENAME"
     * Fix "ALTER LANGUAGE RENAME"
     * Make RemoveFromWaitQueue clean up after itself
       This fixes a lock management error that would only be visible if a
       transaction was kicked out of a wait for a lock (typically by query
       cancel) and then the holder of the lock released it within a very
       narrow window.
     * Fix problem with untyped parameter appearing in "INSERT ... SELECT"
     * Fix "CLUSTER" failure after "ALTER TABLE SET WITHOUT OIDS"

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Check that creator of an aggregate function has the right to
       execute the specified transition functions
       This oversight made it possible to bypass denial of EXECUTE
       permission on a function.
     * Fix security and 64-bit issues in contrib/intagg
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Fix plperl for quote marks in tuple fields
     * Fix display of negative intervals in SQL and GERMAN datestyles
     * Make age(timestamptz) do calculation in local timezone not GMT

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair possible failure to update hint bits on disk
       Under rare circumstances this oversight could lead to "could not
       access transaction status" failures, which qualifies it as a
       potential-data-loss bug.
     * Ensure that hashed outer join does not miss tuples
       Very large left joins using a hash join plan could fail to output
       unmatched left-side rows given just the right data distribution.
     * Disallow running pg_ctl as root
       This is to guard against any possible security issues.
     * Avoid using temp files in "/tmp" in "make_oidjoins_check"
       This has been reported as a security issue, though it's hardly
       worthy of concern since there is no reason for non-developers to
       use this script anyway.
     * Prevent forced backend shutdown from re-emitting prior command
       result
       In rare cases, a client might think that its last command had
       succeeded when it really had been aborted by forced database
       shutdown.
     * Repair bug in pg_stat_get_backend_idset
       This could lead to misbehavior in some of the system-statistics
       views.
     * Fix small memory leak in postmaster
     * Fix "expected both swapped tables to have TOAST tables" bug
       This could arise in cases such as CLUSTER after ALTER TABLE DROP
       COLUMN.
     * Prevent pg_ctl restart from adding -D multiple times
     * Fix problem with NULL values in GiST indexes
     * :: is no longer interpreted as a variable in an ECPG prepare
       statement

Changes

     * Repair possible crash during concurrent B-tree index insertions
       This patch fixes a rare case in which concurrent insertions into a
       B-tree index could result in a server panic. No permanent damage
       would result, but it's still worth a re-release. The bug does not

Migration to Version 7.4.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent possible loss of committed transactions during crash
       Due to insufficient interlocking between transaction commit and
       checkpointing, it was possible for transactions committed just
       before the most recent checkpoint to be lost, in whole or in part,
       following a database crash and restart. This is a serious bug that
       has existed since PostgreSQL 7.1.
     * Check HAVING restriction before evaluating result list of an
       aggregate plan
     * Avoid crash when session's current user ID is deleted
     * Fix hashed crosstab for zero-rows case (Joe)
     * Force cache update after renaming a column in a foreign key
     * Pretty-print UNION queries correctly
     * Make psql handle \r\n newlines properly in COPY IN
     * pg_dump handled ACLs with grant options incorrectly
     * Fix thread support for OS X and Solaris
     * Updated JDBC driver (build 215) with various fixes

     * Improve handling of non-qualified identifiers in GROUP BY clauses
       in sub-selects (Tom)
       Select-list aliases within the sub-select will now take precedence
       over names from outer query levels.
     * Do not generate "NATURAL CROSS JOIN" when decompiling rules (Tom)
     * Add checks for invalid field length in binary COPY (Tom)
       This fixes a difficult-to-exploit security hole.
     * Avoid locking conflict between "ANALYZE" and "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY"
     * Numerous translation updates (various contributors)

                                Release 7.4.2

     Release date: 2004-03-08

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.1. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, it
   might be advisable as the easiest method of incorporating fixes for two
   errors that have been found in the initial contents of 7.4.X system
   catalogs. A dump/initdb/reload sequence using 7.4.2's initdb will
   automatically correct these problems.

   The more severe of the two errors is that data type anyarray has the
   wrong alignment label; this is a problem because the pg_statistic
   system catalog uses anyarray columns. The mislabeling can cause planner
   misestimations and even crashes when planning queries that involve
   WHERE clauses on double-aligned columns (such as float8 and timestamp).
   It is strongly recommended that all installations repair this error,
   either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedure given
   below.

   The lesser error is that the system view pg_settings ought to be marked
   as having public update access, to allow UPDATE pg_settings to be used
   as a substitute for "SET". This can also be fixed either by initdb or
   manually, but it is not necessary to fix unless you want to use UPDATE
   pg_settings.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, the following procedure will work for
   fixing pg_statistic. As the database superuser, do:
-- clear out old data in pg_statistic:
DELETE FROM pg_statistic;
VACUUM pg_statistic;
-- this should update 1 row:
UPDATE pg_type SET typalign = 'd' WHERE oid = 2277;
-- this should update 6 rows:
UPDATE pg_attribute SET attalign = 'd' WHERE atttypid = 2277;
--
-- At this point you MUST start a fresh backend to avoid a crash!
--
-- repopulate pg_statistic:
ANALYZE;

   This can be done in a live database, but beware that all backends
   running in the altered database must be restarted before it is safe to
   repopulate pg_statistic.

   To repair the pg_settings error, simply do:
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON pg_settings TO PUBLIC;

   The above procedures must be carried out in *each* database of an
   installation, including template1, and ideally including template0 as
   well. If you do not fix the template databases then any subsequently
   created databases will contain the same errors. template1 can be fixed
   in the same way as any other database, but fixing template0 requires
   additional steps. First, from any database issue:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';

   Next connect to template0 and perform the above repair procedures.
   Finally, do:
-- re-freeze template0:
VACUUM FREEZE;
-- and protect it against future alterations:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';

     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.4.1

     Release date: 2003-12-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4. For information
   about new features in the 7.4 major release, see the Section called
   Release 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4.1

   A dump/restore is *not* required for those running 7.4.

   If you want to install the fixes in the information schema you need to
   reload it into the database. This is either accomplished by
   initializing a new cluster by running "initdb", or by running the
   following sequence of SQL commands in each database (ideally including
   template1) as a superuser in psql, after installing the new release:
DROP SCHEMA information_schema CASCADE;
\i /usr/local/pgsql/share/information_schema.sql

   Substitute your installation path in the second command.

     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Release 7.4

     Release date: 2003-11-17
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   IN / NOT IN subqueries are now much more efficient
          In previous releases, IN/NOT IN subqueries were joined to the
          upper query by sequentially scanning the subquery looking for a
          match. The 7.4 code uses the same sophisticated techniques used
          by ordinary joins and so is much faster. An IN will now usually
          be as fast as or faster than an equivalent EXISTS subquery; this
          reverses the conventional wisdom that applied to previous
          releases.

   Improved GROUP BY processing by using hash buckets
          In previous releases, rows to be grouped had to be sorted first.
          The 7.4 code can do GROUP BY without sorting, by accumulating
          results into a hash table with one entry per group. It will
          still use the sort technique, however, if the hash table is
          estimated to be too large to fit in sort_mem.

   New multikey hash join capability
          In previous releases, hash joins could only occur on single
          keys. This release allows multicolumn hash joins.

   Queries using the explicit JOIN syntax are now better optimized
          Prior releases evaluated queries using the explicit JOIN syntax
          only in the order implied by the syntax. 7.4 allows full
          optimization of these queries, meaning the optimizer considers
          all possible join orderings and chooses the most efficient.
          Outer joins, however, must still follow the declared ordering.

   Faster and more powerful regular expression code
          The entire regular expression module has been replaced with a
          new version by Henry Spencer, originally written for Tcl. The
          code greatly improves performance and supports several flavors
          of regular expressions.

   Function-inlining for simple SQL functions
          Simple SQL functions can now be inlined by including their SQL
          in the main query. This improves performance by eliminating
          per-call overhead. That means simple SQL functions now behave
          like macros.

   Full support for IPv6 connections and IPv6 address data types
          Previous releases allowed only IPv4 connections, and the IP data
          types only supported IPv4 addresses. This release adds full IPv6
          support in both of these areas.

   Major improvements in SSL performance and reliability
          Several people very familiar with the SSL API have overhauled
          our SSL code to improve SSL key negotiation and error recovery.

   Make free space map efficiently reuse empty index pages, and other free
          space management improvements
          In previous releases, B-tree index pages that were left empty
          because of deleted rows could only be reused by rows with index
          values similar to the rows originally indexed on that page. In
          7.4, "VACUUM" records empty index pages and allows them to be
          reused for any future index rows.

   SQL-standard information schema
          The information schema provides a standardized and stable way to
          access information about the schema objects defined in a
          database.

   Cursors conform more closely to the SQL standard
          The commands "FETCH" and "MOVE" have been overhauled to conform
          more closely to the SQL standard.

   Cursors can exist outside transactions
          These cursors are also called holdable cursors.

   New client-to-server protocol
          The new protocol adds error codes, more status information,
          faster startup, better support for binary data transmission,
          parameter values separated from SQL commands, prepared
          statements available at the protocol level, and cleaner recovery
          from "COPY" failures. The older protocol is still supported by
          both server and clients.

   libpq and ECPG applications are now fully thread-safe
          While previous libpq releases already supported threads, this
          release improves thread safety by fixing some non-thread-safe
          code that was used during database connection startup. The
          "configure" option "--enable-thread-safety" must be used to
          enable this feature.

   New version of full-text indexing
          A new full-text indexing suite is available in
          "contrib/tsearch2".

   New autovacuum tool
          The new autovacuum tool in "contrib/autovacuum" monitors the
          database statistics tables for "INSERT"/"UPDATE"/"DELETE"
          activity and automatically vacuums tables when needed.

   Array handling has been improved and moved into the server core
          Many array limitations have been removed, and arrays behave more
          like fully-supported data types.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.4

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * The server-side autocommit setting was removed and reimplemented in
       client applications and languages. Server-side autocommit was
       causing too many problems with languages and applications that
       wanted to control their own autocommit behavior, so autocommit was
       removed from the server and added to individual client APIs as
       appropriate.
     * Error message wording has changed substantially in this release.
       Significant effort was invested to make the messages more
       consistent and user-oriented. If your applications try to detect
       different error conditions by parsing the error message, you are
       strongly encouraged to use the new error code facility instead.
     * Inner joins using the explicit JOIN syntax might behave differently
       because they are now better optimized.
     * A number of server configuration parameters have been renamed for
       clarity, primarily those related to logging.
     * FETCH 0 or MOVE 0 now does nothing. In prior releases, FETCH 0
       would fetch all remaining rows, and MOVE 0 would move to the end of
       the cursor.
     * "FETCH" and "MOVE" now return the actual number of rows
       fetched/moved, or zero if at the beginning/end of the cursor. Prior
       releases would return the row count passed to the command, not the
       number of rows actually fetched or moved.
     * "COPY" now can process files that use carriage-return or
       carriage-return/line-feed end-of-line sequences. Literal
       carriage-returns and line-feeds are no longer accepted in data
       values; use \r and \n instead.
     * Trailing spaces are now trimmed when converting from type char(n)
       to varchar(n) or text. This is what most people always expected to
       happen anyway.
     * The data type float(p) now measures "p" in binary digits, not
       decimal digits. The new behavior follows the SQL standard.
     * Ambiguous date values now must match the ordering specified by the
       datestyle setting. In prior releases, a date specification of
       10/20/03 was interpreted as a date in October even if datestyle
       specified that the day should be first. 7.4 will throw an error if
       a date specification is invalid for the current setting of
       datestyle.
     * The functions oidrand, oidsrand, and userfntest have been removed.
       These functions were determined to be no longer useful.
     * String literals specifying time-varying date/time values, such as
       'now' or 'today' will no longer work as expected in column default
       expressions; they now cause the time of the table creation to be
       the default, not the time of the insertion. Functions such as
       now(), current_timestamp, or current_date should be used instead.
       In previous releases, there was special code so that strings such
       as 'now' were interpreted at "INSERT" time and not at table
       creation time, but this work around didn't cover all cases. Release
       7.4 now requires that defaults be defined properly using functions
       such as now() or current_timestamp. These will work in all
       situations.
     * The dollar sign ($) is no longer allowed in operator names. It can
       instead be a non-first character in identifiers. This was done to
       improve compatibility with other database systems, and to avoid
       syntax problems when parameter placeholders ($n) are written
       adjacent to operators.

Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the changes between release
   7.4 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Operation Changes

     * Allow IPv6 server connections (Nigel Kukard, Johan Jordaan, Bruce,
       Tom, Kurt Roeckx, Andrew Dunstan)
     * Fix SSL to handle errors cleanly (Nathan Mueller)
       In prior releases, certain SSL API error reports were not handled
       correctly. This release fixes those problems.
     * SSL protocol security and performance improvements (Sean
       Chittenden)
       SSL key renegotiation was happening too frequently, causing poor
       SSL performance. Also, initial key handling was improved.
     * Print lock information when a deadlock is detected (Tom)
       This allows easier debugging of deadlock situations.
     * Update "/tmp" socket modification times regularly to avoid their
       removal (Tom)
       This should help prevent "/tmp" directory cleaner administration
       scripts from removing server socket files.
     * Enable PAM for Mac OS X (Aaron Hillegass)
     * Make B-tree indexes fully WAL-safe (Tom)
       In prior releases, under certain rare cases, a server crash could
       cause B-tree indexes to become corrupt. This release removes those
       last few rare cases.
     * Allow B-tree index compaction and empty page reuse (Tom)
     * Fix inconsistent index lookups during split of first root page
       (Tom)
       In prior releases, when a single-page index split into two pages,
       there was a brief period when another database session could miss
       seeing an index entry. This release fixes that rare failure case.
     * Improve free space map allocation logic (Tom)
     * Preserve free space information between server restarts (Tom)
       In prior releases, the free space map was not saved when the
       postmaster was stopped, so newly started servers had no free space
       information. This release saves the free space map, and reloads it
       when the server is restarted.
     * Add start time to pg_stat_activity (Neil)
     * New code to detect corrupt disk pages; erase with
       zero_damaged_pages (Tom)
     * New client/server protocol: faster, no username length limit, allow
       clean exit from "COPY" (Tom)
     * Add transaction status, table ID, column ID to client/server
       protocol (Tom)
     * Add binary I/O to client/server protocol (Tom)
     * Remove autocommit server setting; move to client applications (Tom)
     * New error message wording, error codes, and three levels of error
       detail (Tom, Joe, Peter)
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance Improvements

     * Add hashing for GROUP BY aggregates (Tom)
     * Make nested-loop joins be smarter about multicolumn indexes (Tom)
     * Allow multikey hash joins (Tom)
     * Improve constant folding (Tom)
     * Add ability to inline simple SQL functions (Tom)
     * Reduce memory usage for queries using complex functions (Tom)
       In prior releases, functions returning allocated memory would not
       free it until the query completed. This release allows the freeing
       of function-allocated memory when the function call completes,
       reducing the total memory used by functions.
     * Improve GEQO optimizer performance (Tom)
       This release fixes several inefficiencies in the way the GEQO
       optimizer manages potential query paths.
     * Allow IN/NOT IN to be handled via hash tables (Tom)
     * Improve NOT IN (subquery) performance (Tom)
     * Allow most IN subqueries to be processed as joins (Tom)
     * Pattern matching operations can use indexes regardless of locale
       (Peter)
       There is no way for non-ASCII locales to use the standard indexes
       for LIKE comparisons. This release adds a way to create a special
       index for LIKE.
     * Allow the postmaster to preload libraries using preload_libraries
       (Joe)
       For shared libraries that require a long time to load, this option
       is available so the library can be preloaded in the postmaster and
       inherited by all database sessions.
     * Improve optimizer cost computations, particularly for subqueries
       (Tom)
     * Avoid sort when subquery ORDER BY matches upper query (Tom)
     * Deduce that WHERE a.x = b.y AND b.y = 42 also means a.x = 42 (Tom)
     * Allow hash/merge joins on complex joins (Tom)
     * Allow hash joins for more data types (Tom)
     * Allow join optimization of explicit inner joins, disable with
       join_collapse_limit (Tom)
     * Add parameter from_collapse_limit to control conversion of
       subqueries to joins (Tom)
     * Use faster and more powerful regular expression code from Tcl
       (Henry Spencer, Tom)
     * Use bit-mapped relation sets in the optimizer (Tom)
     * Improve connection startup time (Tom)
       The new client/server protocol requires fewer network packets to
       start a database session.
     * Improve trigger/constraint performance (Stephan)
     * Improve speed of col IN (const, const, const, ...) (Tom)
     * Fix hash indexes which were broken in rare cases (Tom)
     * Improve hash index concurrency and speed (Tom)
       Prior releases suffered from poor hash index performance,
       particularly for high concurrency situations. This release fixes
       that, and the development group is interested in reports comparing
       B-tree and hash index performance.
     * Align shared buffers on 32-byte boundary for copy speed improvement
       (Manfred Spraul)
       Certain CPU's perform faster data copies when addresses are 32-byte
       aligned.
     * Data type numeric reimplemented for better performance (Tom)
       numeric used to be stored in base 100. The new code uses base
       10000, for significantly better performance.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Configuration Changes

     * Rename server parameter server_min_messages to log_min_messages
       (Bruce)
       This was done so most parameters that control the server logs begin
       with log_.
     * Rename show_*_stats to log_*_stats (Bruce)
     * Rename show_source_port to log_source_port (Bruce)
     * Rename hostname_lookup to log_hostname (Bruce)
     * Add checkpoint_warning to warn of excessive checkpointing (Bruce)
       In prior releases, it was difficult to determine if checkpoint was
       happening too frequently. This feature adds a warning to the server
       logs when excessive checkpointing happens.
     * New read-only server parameters for localization (Tom)
     * Change debug server log messages to output as DEBUG rather than LOG
       (Bruce)
     * Prevent server log variables from being turned off by
       non-superusers (Bruce)
       This is a security feature so non-superusers cannot disable logging
       that was enabled by the administrator.
     * log_min_messages/client_min_messages now controls debug_* output
       (Bruce)
       This centralizes client debug information so all debug output can
       be sent to either the client or server logs.
     * Add Mac OS X Rendezvous server support (Chris Campbell)
       This allows Mac OS X hosts to query the network for available
       PostgreSQL servers.
     * Add ability to print only slow statements using
       log_min_duration_statement (Christopher)
       This is an often requested debugging feature that allows
       administrators to see only slow queries in their server logs.
     * Allow "pg_hba.conf" to accept netmasks in CIDR format (Andrew
       Dunstan)
       This allows administrators to merge the host IP address and netmask
       fields into a single CIDR field in "pg_hba.conf".
     * New read-only parameter is_superuser (Tom)
     * New parameter log_error_verbosity to control error detail (Tom)
       This works with the new error reporting feature to supply
       additional error information like hints, file names and line
       numbers.
     * postgres --describe-config now dumps server config variables (Aizaz
       Ahmed, Peter)
       This option is useful for administration tools that need to know
       the configuration variable names and their minimums, maximums,
       defaults, and descriptions.
     * Add new columns in pg_settings: context, type, source, min_val,
       max_val (Joe)
     * Make default shared_buffers 1000 and max_connections 100, if
       possible (Tom)
       Prior versions defaulted to 64 shared buffers so PostgreSQL would
       start on even very old systems. This release tests the amount of
       shared memory allowed by the platform and selects more reasonable
       default values if possible. Of course, users are still encouraged
       to evaluate their resource load and size shared_buffers
       accordingly.
     * New "pg_hba.conf" record type hostnossl to prevent SSL connections
       (Jon Jensen)
       In prior releases, there was no way to prevent SSL connections if
       both the client and server supported SSL. This option allows that
       capability.
     * Remove parameter geqo_random_seed (Tom)
     * Add server parameter regex_flavor to control regular expression
       processing (Tom)
     * Make "pg_ctl" better handle nonstandard ports (Greg)
     __________________________________________________________________

Query Changes

     * New SQL-standard information schema (Peter)
     * Add read-only transactions (Peter)
     * Print key name and value in foreign-key violation messages (Dmitry
       Tkach)
     * Allow users to see their own queries in pg_stat_activity (Kevin
       Brown)
       In prior releases, only the superuser could see query strings using
       pg_stat_activity. Now ordinary users can see their own query
       strings.
     * Fix aggregates in subqueries to match SQL standard (Tom)
       The SQL standard says that an aggregate function appearing within a
       nested subquery belongs to the outer query if its argument contains
       only outer-query variables. Prior PostgreSQL releases did not
       handle this fine point correctly.
     * Add option to prevent auto-addition of tables referenced in query
       (Nigel J. Andrews)
       By default, tables mentioned in the query are automatically added
       to the FROM clause if they are not already there. This is
       compatible with historic POSTGRES behavior but is contrary to the
       SQL standard. This option allows selecting standard-compatible
       behavior.
     * Allow UPDATE ... SET col = DEFAULT (Rod)
       This allows "UPDATE" to set a column to its declared default value.
     * Allow expressions to be used in LIMIT/OFFSET (Tom)
       In prior releases, LIMIT/OFFSET could only use constants, not
       expressions.
     * Implement CREATE TABLE AS EXECUTE (Neil, Peter)
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation Changes

     * Make "CREATE SEQUENCE" grammar more conforming to SQL:2003 (Neil)
     * Add statement-level triggers (Neil)
       While this allows a trigger to fire at the end of a statement, it
       does not allow the trigger to access all rows modified by the
       statement. This capability is planned for a future release.
     * Add check constraints for domains (Rod)
       This greatly increases the usefulness of domains by allowing them
       to use check constraints.
     * Add "ALTER DOMAIN" (Rod)
       This allows manipulation of existing domains.
     * Fix several zero-column table bugs (Tom)
       PostgreSQL supports zero-column tables. This fixes various bugs
       that occur when using such tables.
     * Have ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY add not-null constraint (Rod)
       In prior releases, ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY would add a unique
       index, but not a not-null constraint. That is fixed in this
       release.
     * Add ALTER TABLE ... WITHOUT OIDS (Rod)
       This allows control over whether new and updated rows will have an
       OID column. This is most useful for saving storage space.
     * Add ALTER SEQUENCE to modify minimum, maximum, increment, cache,
       cycle values (Rod)
     * Add ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER ON (Alvaro Herrera)
       This command is used by "pg_dump" to record the cluster column for
       each table previously clustered. This information is used by
       database-wide cluster to cluster all previously clustered tables.
     * Improve automatic type casting for domains (Rod, Tom)
     * Allow dollar signs in identifiers, except as first character (Tom)
     * Disallow dollar signs in operator names, so x=$1 works (Tom)
     * Allow copying table schema using LIKE subtable, also SQL:2003
       feature INCLUDING DEFAULTS (Rod)
     * Add WITH GRANT OPTION clause to "GRANT" (Peter)
       This enabled "GRANT" to give other users the ability to grant
       privileges on a object.
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Command Changes

     * Add ON COMMIT clause to "CREATE TABLE" for temporary tables (Gavin)
       This adds the ability for a table to be dropped or all rows deleted
       on transaction commit.
     * Allow cursors outside transactions using WITH HOLD (Neil)
       In previous releases, cursors were removed at the end of the
       transaction that created them. Cursors can now be created with the
       WITH HOLD option, which allows them to continue to be accessed
       after the creating transaction has committed.
     * FETCH 0 and MOVE 0 now do nothing (Bruce)
       In previous releases, FETCH 0 fetched all remaining rows, and MOVE
       0 moved to the end of the cursor.
     * Cause "FETCH" and "MOVE" to return the number of rows
       fetched/moved, or zero if at the beginning/end of cursor, per SQL
       standard (Bruce)
       In prior releases, the row count returned by "FETCH" and "MOVE" did
       not accurately reflect the number of rows processed.
     * Properly handle SCROLL with cursors, or report an error (Neil)
       Allowing random access (both forward and backward scrolling) to
       some kinds of queries cannot be done without some additional work.
       If SCROLL is specified when the cursor is created, this additional
       work will be performed. Furthermore, if the cursor has been created
       with NO SCROLL, no random access is allowed.
     * Implement SQL-compatible options FIRST, LAST, ABSOLUTE n, RELATIVE
       n for "FETCH" and "MOVE" (Tom)
     * Allow "EXPLAIN" on "DECLARE CURSOR" (Tom)
     * Allow "CLUSTER" to use index marked as pre-clustered by default
       (Alvaro Herrera)
     * Allow "CLUSTER" to cluster all tables (Alvaro Herrera)
       This allows all previously clustered tables in a database to be
       reclustered with a single command.
     * Prevent "CLUSTER" on partial indexes (Tom)
     * Allow DOS and Mac line-endings in "COPY" files (Bruce)
     * Disallow literal carriage return as a data value,
       backslash-carriage-return and \r are still allowed (Bruce)
     * "COPY" changes (binary, \.) (Tom)
     * Recover from "COPY" failure cleanly (Tom)
     * Prevent possible memory leaks in "COPY" (Tom)
     * Make "TRUNCATE" transaction-safe (Rod)
       "TRUNCATE" can now be used inside a transaction. If the transaction
       aborts, the changes made by the "TRUNCATE" are automatically rolled
       back.
     * Allow prepare/bind of utility commands like "FETCH" and "EXPLAIN"
       (Tom)
     * Add "EXPLAIN EXECUTE" (Neil)
     * Improve "VACUUM" performance on indexes by reducing WAL traffic
       (Tom)
     * Functional indexes have been generalized into indexes on
       expressions (Tom)
       In prior releases, functional indexes only supported a simple
       function applied to one or more column names. This release allows
       any type of scalar expression.
     * Have "SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION" match input to "SET TRANSACTION
       ISOLATION" (Tom)
     * Have "COMMENT ON DATABASE" on nonlocal database generate a warning,
       rather than an error (Rod)
       Database comments are stored in database-local tables so comments
       on a database have to be stored in each database.
     * Improve reliability of "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" (Tom)
     * Allow "REINDEX" to reliably reindex nonshared system catalog
       indexes (Tom)
       This allows system tables to be reindexed without the requirement
       of a standalone session, which was necessary in previous releases.
       The only tables that now require a standalone session for
       reindexing are the global system tables pg_database, pg_shadow, and
       pg_group.
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Type and Function Changes

     * New server parameter extra_float_digits to control precision
       display of floating-point numbers (Pedro Ferreira, Tom)
       This controls output precision which was causing regression testing
       problems.
     * Allow +1300 as a numeric time-zone specifier, for FJST (Tom)
     * Remove rarely used functions oidrand, oidsrand, and userfntest
       functions (Neil)
     * Add md5() function to main server, already in "contrib/pgcrypto"
       (Joe)
       An MD5 function was frequently requested. For more complex
       encryption capabilities, use "contrib/pgcrypto".
     * Increase date range of timestamp (John Cochran)
     * Change EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp) so timestamp without time zone
       is assumed to be in local time, not GMT (Tom)
     * Trap division by zero in case the operating system doesn't prevent
       it (Tom)
     * Change the numeric data type internally to base 10000 (Tom)
     * New hostmask() function (Greg Wickham)
     * Fixes for to_char() and to_timestamp() (Karel)
     * Allow functions that can take any argument data type and return any
       data type, using anyelement and anyarray (Joe)
       This allows the creation of functions that can work with any data
       type.
     * Arrays can now be specified as ARRAY[1,2,3],
       ARRAY[['a','b'],['c','d']], or ARRAY[ARRAY[ARRAY[2]]] (Joe)
     * Allow proper comparisons for arrays, including ORDER BY and
       DISTINCT support (Joe)
     * Allow indexes on array columns (Joe)
     * Allow array concatenation with || (Joe)
     * Allow WHERE qualification expr op ANY/SOME/ALL (array_expr) (Joe)
       This allows arrays to behave like a list of values, for purposes
       like SELECT * FROM tab WHERE col IN (array_val).
     * New array functions array_append, array_cat, array_lower,
       array_prepend, array_to_string, array_upper, string_to_array (Joe)
     * Allow user defined aggregates to use polymorphic functions (Joe)
     * Allow assignments to empty arrays (Joe)
     * Allow 60 in seconds fields of time, timestamp, and interval input
       values (Tom)
       Sixty-second values are needed for leap seconds.
     * Allow cidr data type to be cast to text (Tom)
     * Disallow invalid time zone names in SET TIMEZONE
     * Trim trailing spaces when char is cast to varchar or text (Tom)
     * Make float(p) measure the precision "p" in binary digits, not
       decimal digits (Tom)
     * Add IPv6 support to the inet and cidr data types (Michael Graff)
     * Add family() function to report whether address is IPv4 or IPv6
       (Michael Graff)
     * Have SHOW datestyle generate output similar to that used by SET
       datestyle (Tom)
     * Make EXTRACT(TIMEZONE) and SET/SHOW TIME ZONE follow the SQL
       convention for the sign of time zone offsets, i.e., positive is
       east from UTC (Tom)
     * Fix date_trunc('quarter', ...) (Bjthe Zoltn)
       Prior releases returned an incorrect value for this function call.
     * Make initcap() more compatible with Oracle (Mike Nolan)
       initcap() now uppercases a letter appearing after any
       non-alphanumeric character, rather than only after whitespace.
     * Allow only datestyle field order for date values not in ISO-8601
       format (Greg)
     * Add new datestyle values MDY, DMY, and YMD to set input field
       order; honor US and European for backward compatibility (Tom)
     * String literals like 'now' or 'today' will no longer work as a
       column default. Use functions such as now(), current_timestamp
       instead. (change required for prepared statements) (Tom)
     * Treat NaN as larger than any other value in min()/max() (Tom)
       NaN was already sorted after ordinary numeric values for most
       purposes, but min() and max() didn't get this right.
     * Prevent interval from suppressing :00 seconds display
     * New functions pg_get_triggerdef(prettyprint) and
       pg_conversion_is_visible() (Christopher)
     * Allow time to be specified as 040506 or 0405 (Tom)
     * Input date order must now be YYYY-MM-DD (with 4-digit year) or
       match datestyle
     * Make pg_get_constraintdef support unique, primary-key, and check
       constraints (Christopher)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server-Side Language Changes

     * Prevent PL/pgSQL crash when RETURN NEXT is used on a zero-row
       record variable (Tom)
     * Make PL/Python's spi_execute interface handle null values properly
       (Andrew Bosma)
     * Allow PL/pgSQL to declare variables of composite types without
       %ROWTYPE (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Python's _quote() function to handle big integers
     * Make PL/Python an untrusted language, now called plpythonu (Kevin
       Jacobs, Tom)
       The Python language no longer supports a restricted execution
       environment, so the trusted version of PL/Python was removed. If
       this situation changes, a version of PL/Python that can be used by
       non-superusers will be readded.
     * Allow polymorphic PL/pgSQL functions (Joe, Tom)
     * Allow polymorphic SQL functions (Joe)
     * Improved compiled function caching mechanism in PL/pgSQL with full
       support for polymorphism (Joe)
     * Add new parameter $0 in PL/pgSQL representing the function's actual
       return type (Joe)
     * Allow PL/Tcl and PL/Python to use the same trigger on multiple
       tables (Tom)
     * Fixed PL/Tcl's spi_prepare to accept fully qualified type names in
       the parameter type list (Jan)
     __________________________________________________________________

psql Changes

     * Add \pset pager always to always use pager (Greg)
       This forces the pager to be used even if the number of rows is less
       than the screen height. This is valuable for rows that wrap across
       several screen rows.
     * Improve tab completion (Rod, Ross Reedstrom, Ian Barwick)
     * Reorder \? help into groupings (Harald Armin Massa, Bruce)
     * Add backslash commands for listing schemas, casts, and conversions
       (Christopher)
     * "\encoding" now changes based on the server parameter
       client_encoding (Tom)
       In previous versions, "\encoding" was not aware of encoding changes
       made using SET client_encoding.
     * Save editor buffer into readline history (Ross)
       When "\e" is used to edit a query, the result is saved in the
       readline history for retrieval using the up arrow.
     * Improve "\d" display (Christopher)
     * Enhance HTML mode to be more standards-conforming (Greg)
     * New "\set AUTOCOMMIT off" capability (Tom)
       This takes the place of the removed server parameter autocommit.
     * New "\set VERBOSITY" to control error detail (Tom)
       This controls the new error reporting details.
     * New prompt escape sequence %x to show transaction status (Tom)
     * Long options for psql are now available on all platforms
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump Changes

     * Multiple pg_dump fixes, including tar format and large objects
     * Allow pg_dump to dump specific schemas (Neil)
     * Make pg_dump preserve column storage characteristics (Christopher)
       This preserves ALTER TABLE ... SET STORAGE information.
     * Make pg_dump preserve "CLUSTER" characteristics (Christopher)
     * Have pg_dumpall use "GRANT"/"REVOKE" to dump database-level
       privileges (Tom)
     * Allow pg_dumpall to support the options "-a", "-s", "-x" of pg_dump
       (Tom)
     * Prevent pg_dump from lowercasing identifiers specified on the
       command line (Tom)
     * pg_dump options "--use-set-session-authorization" and
       "--no-reconnect" now do nothing, all dumps use "SET SESSION
       AUTHORIZATION"
       pg_dump no longer reconnects to switch users, but instead always
       uses "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION". This will reduce password
       prompting during restores.
     * Long options for pg_dump are now available on all platforms
       PostgreSQL now includes its own long-option processing routines.
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq Changes

     * Add function PQfreemem for freeing memory on Windows, suggested for
       "NOTIFY" (Bruce)
       Windows requires that memory allocated in a library be freed by a
       function in the same library, hence free() doesn't work for freeing
       memory allocated by libpq. PQfreemem is the proper way to free
       libpq memory, especially on Windows, and is recommended for other
       platforms as well.
     * Document service capability, and add sample file (Bruce)
       This allows clients to look up connection information in a central
       file on the client machine.
     * Make PQsetdbLogin have the same defaults as PQconnectdb (Tom)
     * Allow libpq to cleanly fail when result sets are too large (Tom)
     * Improve performance of function PQunescapeBytea (Ben Lamb)
     * Allow thread-safe libpq with "configure" option
       "--enable-thread-safety" (Lee Kindness, Philip Yarra)
     * Allow function pqInternalNotice to accept a format string and
       arguments instead of just a preformatted message (Tom, Sean
       Chittenden)
     * Control SSL negotiation with sslmode values disable, allow, prefer,
       and require (Jon Jensen)
     * Allow new error codes and levels of text (Tom)
     * Allow access to the underlying table and column of a query result
       (Tom)
       This is helpful for query-builder applications that want to know
       the underlying table and column names associated with a specific
       result set.
     * Allow access to the current transaction status (Tom)
     * Add ability to pass binary data directly to the server (Tom)
     * Add function PQexecPrepared and PQsendQueryPrepared functions which
       perform bind/execute of previously prepared statements (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

JDBC Changes

     * Allow setNull on updateable result sets
     * Allow executeBatch on a prepared statement (Barry)
     * Support SSL connections (Barry)
     * Handle schema names in result sets (Paul Sorenson)
     * Add refcursor support (Nic Ferrier)
     __________________________________________________________________

Miscellaneous Interface Changes

     * Prevent possible memory leak or core dump during libpgtcl shutdown
       (Tom)
     * Add Informix compatibility to ECPG (Michael)
       This allows ECPG to process embedded C programs that were written
       using certain Informix extensions.
     * Add type decimal to ECPG that is fixed length, for Informix
       (Michael)
     * Allow thread-safe embedded SQL programs with "configure" option
       "--enable-thread-safety" (Lee Kindness, Bruce)
       This allows multiple threads to access the database at the same
       time.
     * Moved Python client PyGreSQL to http://www.pygresql.org (Marc)
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code Changes

     * Prevent need for separate platform geometry regression result files
       (Tom)
     * Improved PPC locking primitive (Reinhard Max)
     * New function palloc0 to allocate and clear memory (Bruce)
     * Fix locking code for s390x CPU (64-bit) (Tom)
     * Allow OpenBSD to use local ident credentials (William Ahern)
     * Make query plan trees read-only to executor (Tom)
     * Add Darwin startup scripts (David Wheeler)
     * Allow libpq to compile with Borland C++ compiler (Lester Godwin,
       Karl Waclawek)
     * Use our own version of getopt_long() if needed (Peter)
     * Convert administration scripts to C (Peter)
     * Bison >= 1.85 is now required to build the PostgreSQL grammar, if
       building from CVS
     * Merge documentation into one book (Peter)
     * Add Windows compatibility functions (Bruce)
     * Allow client interfaces to compile under MinGW (Bruce)
     * New ereport() function for error reporting (Tom)
     * Support Intel compiler on Linux (Peter)
     * Improve Linux startup scripts (Slawomir Sudnik, Darko Prenosil)
     * Add support for AMD Opteron and Itanium (Jeffrey W. Baker, Bruce)
     * Remove "--enable-recode" option from "configure"
       This was no longer needed now that we have "CREATE CONVERSION".
     * Generate a compile error if spinlock code is not found (Bruce)
       Platforms without spinlock code will now fail to compile, rather
       than silently using semaphores. This failure can be disabled with a
       new "configure" option.
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib Changes

     * Change dbmirror license to BSD
     * Improve earthdistance (Bruno Wolff III)
     * Portability improvements to pgcrypto (Marko Kreen)
     * Prevent crash in xml (John Gray, Michael Richards)
     * Update oracle
     * Update mysql
     * Update cube (Bruno Wolff III)
     * Update earthdistance to use cube (Bruno Wolff III)

       Mrcio Smiderle)
     * Remove array module because features now included by default (Joe)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.3.21

     Release date: 2008-01-07

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.20, including fixes
   for significant security issues.

   This is expected to be the last PostgreSQL release in the 7.3.X series.
   Users are encouraged to update to a newer release branch soon.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.21

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.13, see the release notes
   for 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
       the user running "VACUUM", "ANALYZE", etc (Tom)
       Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates
       are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been
       understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if
       one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that
       triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of
       risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will
       be executed by routine maintenance operations such as "VACUUM
       FULL", which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser
       account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with
       superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition
       and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for
       standard maintenance operations (including "VACUUM", "ANALYZE",
       "REINDEX", and "CLUSTER") to execute as the table owner rather than
       the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism
       already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing
       this security measure, execution of "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" and
       "SET ROLE" is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.
       (CVE-2007-6600)
     * Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
       password authentication, as a security measure (Joe)
       The fix that appeared for this in 7.3.20 was incomplete, as it
       plugged the hole for only some "dblink" functions. (CVE-2007-6601,
       CVE-2007-3278)
     * Fix potential crash in translate() when using a multibyte database
       encoding (Tom)
     * Make "contrib/tablefunc"'s crosstab() handle NULL rowid as a
       category in its own right, rather than crashing (Joe)
     * Require a specific version of Autoconf to be used when
       re-generating the "configure" script (Peter)
       This affects developers and packagers only. The change was made to
       prevent accidental use of untested combinations of Autoconf and
       PostgreSQL versions. You can remove the version check if you really
       want to use a different Autoconf version, but it's your
       responsibility whether the result works or not.

                               Release 7.3.20

     Release date: 2007-09-17

   This release contains fixes from 7.3.19.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.20

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you

   for 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent index corruption when a transaction inserts rows and then
       aborts close to the end of a concurrent "VACUUM" on the same table
       (Tom)
     * Make "CREATE DOMAIN ... DEFAULT NULL" work properly (Tom)
     * Fix crash when log_min_error_statement logging runs out of memory
       (Tom)
     * Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
       password authentication, as a security measure (Joe)

                               Release 7.3.19

     Release date: 2007-04-23

   This release contains fixes from 7.3.18, including a security fix.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.19

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.13, see the release notes
   for 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Support explicit placement of the temporary-table schema within
       search_path, and disable searching it for functions and operators
       (Tom)
       This is needed to allow a security-definer function to set a truly
       secure value of search_path. Without it, an unprivileged SQL user
       can use temporary objects to execute code with the privileges of
       the security-definer function (CVE-2007-2138). See "CREATE
       FUNCTION" for more information.
     * Fix potential-data-corruption bug in how "VACUUM FULL" handles
       "UPDATE" chains (Tom, Pavan Deolasee)

Migration to Version 7.3.18

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.13, see the release notes
   for 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Remove security vulnerability that allowed connected users to read
       backend memory (Tom)
       The vulnerability involves changing the data type of a table column
       used in a SQL function (CVE-2007-0555). This error can easily be
       exploited to cause a backend crash, and in principle might be used
       to read database content that the user should not be able to
       access.
     * Fix rare bug wherein btree index page splits could fail due to
       choosing an infeasible split point (Heikki Linnakangas)
     * Tighten security of multi-byte character processing for UTF8
       sequences over three bytes long (Tom)

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * to_number() and to_char(numeric) are now STABLE, not IMMUTABLE, for
       new initdb installs (Tom)
       This is because lc_numeric can potentially change the output of
       these functions.
     * Improve index usage of regular expressions that use parentheses
       (Tom)
       This improves psql \d performance also.

                               Release 7.3.15

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.14, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.15

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.13, see the release notes
   for 7.3.13.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 might require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       might require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote
       is in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314. Applications that use
       multiple PostgreSQL connections concurrently should migrate to
       PQescapeStringConn() and PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that
       escaping is done correctly for the settings in use in each database
       connection. Applications that do string escaping "by hand" should
       be modified to rely on library routines instead.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, alt_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks

                               Release 7.3.14

     Release date: 2006-02-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.14

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.13, see the release notes
   for 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix potential crash in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" (CVE-2006-0553)
       An unprivileged user could crash the server process, resulting in
       momentary denial of service to other users, if the server has been
       compiled with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to
       Akio Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 7.3.11 release.
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog file creation (Tom)
     * Fix to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators (Tom)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.3.13

     Release date: 2006-01-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.12.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.13

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.10, see the release notes
   for 7.3.10. Also, you might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual
   columns after updating, if you are affected by the locale or plperl
   issues described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You might need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.12

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.10, see the release notes
   for 7.3.10.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix race condition in transaction log management
       There was a narrow window in which an I/O operation could be
       initiated for the wrong page, leading to an Assert failure or data
       corruption.
     * "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix longstanding planning error for outer joins
       This bug sometimes caused a bogus error "RIGHT JOIN is only
       supported with merge-joinable join conditions".
     * Prevent core dump in pg_autovacuum when a table has been dropped

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.11

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.10, see the release notes
   for 7.3.10.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix error that allowed "VACUUM" to remove ctid chains too soon, and
       add more checking in code that follows ctid links
       This fixes a long-standing problem that could cause crashes in very
       rare circumstances.
     * Fix CHAR() to properly pad spaces to the specified length when
       using a multiple-byte character set (Yoshiyuki Asaba)
       In prior releases, the padding of CHAR() was incorrect because it
       only padded to the specified number of bytes without considering
       how many characters were stored.
     * Fix missing rows in queries like UPDATE a=... WHERE a... with GiST
       index on column a
     * Improve checking for partially-written WAL pages
     * Improve robustness of signal handling when SSL is enabled
     * Various memory leakage fixes
     * Various portability improvements
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to handle var := var correctly when the variable is of
       pass-by-reference type
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.3.10

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.9, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.10

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, it is
   one possible way of handling a significant security problem that has
   been found in the initial contents of 7.3.X system catalogs. A
   dump/initdb/reload sequence using 7.3.10's initdb will automatically
   correct this problem.

   The security problem is that the built-in character set encoding
   conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged
   users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not
   secure against malicious choices of arguments. The fix involves
   changing the declared parameter list of these functions so that they
   can no longer be invoked from SQL commands. (This does not affect their
   normal use by the encoding conversion machinery.) It is strongly
   recommended that all installations repair this error, either by initdb
   or by following the manual repair procedure given below. The error at
   least allows unprivileged database users to crash their server process,
   and might allow unprivileged users to gain the privileges of a database
   superuser.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the following procedure
   instead. As the database superuser, do:
BEGIN;
UPDATE pg_proc SET proargtypes[3] = 'internal'::regtype
WHERE pronamespace = 11 AND pronargs = 5
     AND proargtypes[2] = 'cstring'::regtype;
-- The command should report having updated 90 rows;
-- if not, rollback and investigate instead of committing!
COMMIT;

   The above procedure must be carried out in *each* database of an
   installation, including template1, and ideally including template0 as
   well. If you do not fix the template databases then any subsequently
   created databases will contain the same error. template1 can be fixed
   in the same way as any other database, but fixing template0 requires
   additional steps. First, from any database issue:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';

   Next connect to template0 and perform the above repair procedure.
   Finally, do:
-- re-freeze template0:
VACUUM FREEZE;
-- and protect it against future alterations:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change encoding function signature to prevent misuse
     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix comparisons of TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
       The comparison code was wrong in the case where the
       --enable-integer-datetimes configuration switch had been used.
       NOTE: if you have an index on a TIME WITH TIME ZONE column, it will
       need to be "REINDEX"ed after installing this update, because the
       fix corrects the sort order of column values.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Fix mis-display of negative fractional seconds in INTERVAL values
       This error only occurred when the --enable-integer-datetimes
       configuration switch had been used.
     * Additional buffer overrun checks in plpgsql (Neil)
     * Fix pg_dump to dump trigger names containing % correctly (Neil)
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from dumping core for month-related
       formats
     * Fix "contrib/pgcrypto" for newer OpenSSL builds (Marko Kreen)
     * Still more 64-bit fixes for "contrib/intagg"
     * Prevent incorrect optimization of functions returning RECORD

                                Release 7.3.9

     Release date: 2005-01-31

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.8, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.9

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Check that creator of an aggregate function has the right to
       execute the specified transition functions
       This oversight made it possible to bypass denial of EXECUTE
       permission on a function.
     * Fix security and 64-bit issues in contrib/intagg
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Fix plperl for quote marks in tuple fields
     * Fix display of negative intervals in SQL and GERMAN datestyles

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair possible failure to update hint bits on disk
       Under rare circumstances this oversight could lead to "could not
       access transaction status" failures, which qualifies it as a
       potential-data-loss bug.
     * Ensure that hashed outer join does not miss tuples
       Very large left joins using a hash join plan could fail to output
       unmatched left-side rows given just the right data distribution.
     * Disallow running pg_ctl as root
       This is to guard against any possible security issues.
     * Avoid using temp files in /tmp in make_oidjoins_check
       This has been reported as a security issue, though it's hardly
       worthy of concern since there is no reason for non-developers to
       use this script anyway.

   items.

Migration to Version 7.3.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent possible loss of committed transactions during crash
       Due to insufficient interlocking between transaction commit and
       checkpointing, it was possible for transactions committed just
       before the most recent checkpoint to be lost, in whole or in part,
       following a database crash and restart. This is a serious bug that
       has existed since PostgreSQL 7.1.
     * Remove asymmetrical word processing in tsearch (Teodor)
     * Properly schema-qualify function names when pg_dump'ing a CAST

Migration to Version 7.3.6

   A dump/restore is *not* required for those running 7.3.*.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Revert erroneous changes in rule permissions checking
       A patch applied in 7.3.3 to fix a corner case in rule permissions
       checks turns out to have disabled rule-related permissions checks
       in many not-so-corner cases. This would for example allow users to
       insert into views they weren't supposed to have permission to
       insert into. We have therefore reverted the 7.3.3 patch. The
       original bug will be fixed in 8.0.
     * Repair incorrect order of operations in GetNewTransactionId()
       This bug could result in failure under out-of-disk-space
       conditions, including inability to restart even after disk space is
       freed.
     * Ensure configure selects -fno-strict-aliasing even when an external
       value for CFLAGS is supplied
       On some platforms, building with -fstrict-aliasing causes bugs.
     * Make pg_restore handle 64-bit off_t correctly
       This bug prevented proper restoration from archive files exceeding
       4 GB.
     * Make contrib/dblink not assume that local and remote type OIDs
       match (Joe)
     * Quote connectby()'s start_with argument properly (Joe)
     * Don't crash when a rowtype argument to a plpgsql function is NULL
     * Avoid generating invalid character encoding sequences in corner
       cases when planning LIKE operations
     * Ensure text_position() cannot scan past end of source string in
       multibyte cases (Korea PostgreSQL Users' Group)
     * Fix index optimization and selectivity estimates for LIKE
       operations on bytea columns (Joe)

     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Release 7.3

     Release date: 2002-11-27
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   Schemas
          Schemas allow users to create objects in separate namespaces, so
          two people or applications can have tables with the same name.
          There is also a public schema for shared tables. Table/index
          creation can be restricted by removing privileges on the public
          schema.

   Drop Column
          PostgreSQL now supports the ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN
          functionality.

   Table Functions
          Functions returning multiple rows and/or multiple columns are
          now much easier to use than before. You can call such a "table
          function" in the SELECT FROM clause, treating its output like a
          table. Also, PL/pgSQL functions can now return sets.

   Prepared Queries
          PostgreSQL now supports prepared queries, for improved
          performance.

   Dependency Tracking
          PostgreSQL now records object dependencies, which allows
          improvements in many areas. "DROP" statements now take either
          CASCADE or RESTRICT to control whether dependent objects are
          also dropped.

   Privileges
          Functions and procedural languages now have privileges, and
          functions can be defined to run with the privileges of their
          creator.

   Internationalization
          Both multibyte and locale support are now always enabled.

   Logging
          A variety of logging options have been enhanced.

   Interfaces
          A large number of interfaces have been moved to
          http://gborg.postgresql.org where they can be developed and
          released independently.

   Functions/Identifiers
          By default, functions can now take up to 32 parameters, and
          identifiers can be up to 63 bytes long. Also, OPAQUE is now
          deprecated: there are specific "pseudo-datatypes" to represent
          each of the former meanings of OPAQUE in function argument and
          result types.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.3

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release. If your application examines the system
   catalogs, additional changes will be required due to the introduction
   of schemas in 7.3; for more information, see:
   http://developer.postgresql.org/~momjian/upgrade_tips_7.3.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * Pre-6.3 clients are no longer supported.
     * "pg_hba.conf" now has a column for the user name and additional
       features. Existing files need to be adjusted.
     * Several "postgresql.conf" logging parameters have been renamed.
     * LIMIT #,# has been disabled; use LIMIT # OFFSET #.
     * "INSERT" statements with column lists must specify a value for each
       specified column. For example, INSERT INTO tab (col1, col2) VALUES
       ('val1') is now invalid. It's still allowed to supply fewer columns
       than expected if the "INSERT" does not have a column list.
     * serial columns are no longer automatically UNIQUE; thus, an index
       will not automatically be created.
     * A "SET" command inside an aborted transaction is now rolled back.
     * "COPY" no longer considers missing trailing columns to be null. All
       columns need to be specified. (However, one can achieve a similar
       effect by specifying a column list in the "COPY" command.)
     * The data type timestamp is now equivalent to timestamp without time
       zone, instead of timestamp with time zone.
     * Pre-7.3 databases loaded into 7.3 will not have the new object
       dependencies for serial columns, unique constraints, and foreign
       keys. See the directory "contrib/adddepend/" for a detailed
       description and a script that will add such dependencies.
     * An empty string ('') is no longer allowed as the input into an
       integer field. Formerly, it was silently interpreted as 0.

                                Release 7.2.8

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.7, including one
   security-related issue.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.2.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Additional buffer overrun checks in plpgsql (Neil)
     * Fix pg_dump to dump index names and trigger names containing %
       correctly (Neil)
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from dumping core for month-related
       formats
     * Fix "contrib/pgcrypto" for newer OpenSSL builds (Marko Kreen)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.2.7

     Release date: 2005-01-31

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.6, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.2.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Fix display of negative intervals in SQL and GERMAN datestyles

                                Release 7.2.6

     Release date: 2004-10-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.2.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair possible failure to update hint bits on disk
       Under rare circumstances this oversight could lead to "could not
       access transaction status" failures, which qualifies it as a
       potential-data-loss bug.
     * Ensure that hashed outer join does not miss tuples
       Very large left joins using a hash join plan could fail to output
       unmatched left-side rows given just the right data distribution.
     * Disallow running pg_ctl as root
       This is to guard against any possible security issues.
     * Avoid using temp files in /tmp in make_oidjoins_check
       This has been reported as a security issue, though it's hardly
       worthy of concern since there is no reason for non-developers to
       use this script anyway.
     * Update to newer versions of Bison

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.2.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent possible loss of committed transactions during crash
       Due to insufficient interlocking between transaction commit and
       checkpointing, it was possible for transactions committed just
       before the most recent checkpoint to be lost, in whole or in part,
       following a database crash and restart. This is a serious bug that
       has existed since PostgreSQL 7.1.
     * Fix corner case for btree search in parallel with first root page
       split
     * Fix buffer overrun in to_ascii (Guido Notari)
     * Fix core dump in deadlock detection on machines where char is
       unsigned
     * Fix failure to respond to "pg_ctl stop -m fast" after
       Async_NotifyHandler runs
     * Repair memory leaks in pg_dump
     * Avoid conflict with system definition of isblank() function or
       macro

     * Ensure pg_clog updates are sync'd to disk before marking checkpoint
       complete
     * Avoid integer overflow during large hash joins
     * Make GROUP commands work when pg_group.grolist is large enough to
       be toasted

       recognized
     * Fix integer overflows in circle_poly(), path_encode(), path_add()
       (Neil)
     * Repair long-standing logic errors in lseg_eq(), lseg_ne(),
       lseg_center()

Overview

   This release improves PostgreSQL for use in high-volume applications.

   Major changes in this release:

   VACUUM
          Vacuuming no longer locks tables, thus allowing normal user
          access during the vacuum. A new "VACUUM FULL" command does
          old-style vacuum by locking the table and shrinking the on-disk
          copy of the table.

   Transactions
          There is no longer a problem with installations that exceed four
          billion transactions.

   OIDs
          OIDs are now optional. Users can now create tables without OIDs
          for cases where OID usage is excessive.

   Optimizer
          The system now computes histogram column statistics during
          "ANALYZE", allowing much better optimizer choices.

   Security
          A new MD5 encryption option allows more secure storage and
          transfer of passwords. A new Unix-domain socket authentication
          option is available on Linux and BSD systems.

   Statistics
          Administrators can use the new table access statistics module to
          get fine-grained information about table and index usage.

   Internationalization
          Program and library messages can now be displayed in several
          languages.

   A dump/restore using "pg_dump" is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * The semantics of the "VACUUM" command have changed in this release.
       You might wish to update your maintenance procedures accordingly.
     * In this release, comparisons using = NULL will always return false
       (or NULL, more precisely). Previous releases automatically
       transformed this syntax to IS NULL. The old behavior can be
       re-enabled using a "postgresql.conf" parameter.
     * The "pg_hba.conf" and "pg_ident.conf" configuration is now only
       reloaded after receiving a SIGHUP signal, not with each connection.
     * The function "octet_length()" now returns the uncompressed data
       length.
     * The date/time value 'current' is no longer available. You will need
       to rewrite your applications.
     * The timestamp(), time(), and interval() functions are no longer
       available. Instead of timestamp(), use timestamp 'string' or CAST.

   The SELECT ... LIMIT #,# syntax will be removed in the next release.
   You should change your queries to use separate LIMIT and OFFSET
   clauses, e.g. LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20.

                                 Release 7.1

     Release date: 2001-04-13

   This release focuses on removing limitations that have existed in the
   PostgreSQL code for many years.

   Major changes in this release:

   Write-ahead Log (WAL)
          To maintain database consistency in case of an operating system
          crash, previous releases of PostgreSQL have forced all data
          modifications to disk before each transaction commit. With WAL,
          only one log file must be flushed to disk, greatly improving
          performance. If you have been using -F in previous releases to
          disable disk flushes, you might want to consider discontinuing
          its use.

   TOAST
          TOAST - Previous releases had a compiled-in row length limit,
          typically 8k - 32k. This limit made storage of long text fields
          difficult. With TOAST, long rows of any length can be stored
          with good performance.

   Outer Joins
          We now support outer joins. The UNION/NOT IN workaround for
          outer joins is no longer required. We use the SQL92 outer join
          syntax.

   Function Manager
          The previous C function manager did not handle null values
          properly, nor did it support 64-bit CPU's (Alpha). The new
          function manager does. You can continue using your old custom
          functions, but you might want to rewrite them in the future to
          use the new function manager call interface.

   Complex Queries
          A large number of complex queries that were unsupported in
          previous releases now work. Many combinations of views,
          aggregates, UNION, LIMIT, cursors, subqueries, and inherited
          tables now work properly. Inherited tables are now accessed by
          default. Subqueries in FROM are now supported.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.1

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

                                 Release 7.0

     Release date: 2000-05-08

   This release contains improvements in many areas, demonstrating the
   continued growth of PostgreSQL. There are more improvements and fixes
   in 7.0 than in any previous release. The developers have confidence
   that this is the best release yet; we do our best to put out only solid
   releases, and this one is no exception.

   Major changes in this release:

   Foreign Keys
          Foreign keys are now implemented, with the exception of PARTIAL
          MATCH foreign keys. Many users have been asking for this
          feature, and we are pleased to offer it.

   Optimizer Overhaul
          Continuing on work started a year ago, the optimizer has been
          improved, allowing better query plan selection and faster
          performance with less memory usage.

   Updated psql
          psql, our interactive terminal monitor, has been updated with a
          variety of new features. See the psql manual page for details.

   Join Syntax
          SQL92 join syntax is now supported, though only as INNER JOIN
          for this release. JOIN, NATURAL JOIN, JOIN/USING, and JOIN/ON
          are available, as are column correlation names.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 7.0

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release of PostgreSQL. For those upgrading from
   6.5.*, you can instead use pg_upgrade to upgrade to this release;
   however, a full dump/reload installation is always the most robust
   method for upgrades.

   Interface and compatibility issues to consider for the new release
   include:

     * The date/time types datetime and timespan have been superseded by
       the SQL92-defined types timestamp and interval. Although there has
       been some effort to ease the transition by allowing PostgreSQL to
       recognize the deprecated type names and translate them to the new
       type names, this mechanism cannot be completely transparent to your
       existing application.
     * The optimizer has been substantially improved in the area of query
       cost estimation. In some cases, this will result in decreased query
       times as the optimizer makes a better choice for the preferred
       plan. However, in a small number of cases, usually involving
       pathological distributions of data, your query times might go up.
       If you are dealing with large amounts of data, you might want to
       check your queries to verify performance.
     * The JDBC and ODBC interfaces have been upgraded and extended.
     * The string function CHAR_LENGTH is now a native function. Previous
       versions translated this into a call to LENGTH, which could result
       in ambiguity with other types implementing LENGTH such as the
       geometric types.

                                 Release 6.5

     Release date: 1999-06-09

   This release marks a major step in the development team's mastery of
   the source code we inherited from Berkeley. You will see we are now
   easily adding major features, thanks to the increasing size and
   experience of our world-wide development team.

   Here is a brief summary of the more notable changes:

   Multiversion concurrency control(MVCC)
          This removes our old table-level locking, and replaces it with a
          locking system that is superior to most commercial database
          systems. In a traditional system, each row that is modified is
          locked until committed, preventing reads by other users. MVCC
          uses the natural multiversion nature of PostgreSQL to allow
          readers to continue reading consistent data during writer
          activity. Writers continue to use the compact pg_log transaction
          system. This is all performed without having to allocate a lock
          for every row like traditional database systems. So, basically,
          we no longer are restricted by simple table-level locking; we
          have something better than row-level locking.

   Hot backups from pg_dump
          pg_dump takes advantage of the new MVCC features to give a
          consistent database dump/backup while the database stays online
          and available for queries.

   Numeric data type
          We now have a true numeric data type, with user-specified
          precision.

   Temporary tables
          Temporary tables are guaranteed to have unique names within a
          database session, and are destroyed on session exit.

   New SQL features
          We now have CASE, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT statement support. We
          have new LIMIT/OFFSET, SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL, SELECT
          ... FOR UPDATE, and an improved LOCK TABLE command.

   Speedups
          We continue to speed up PostgreSQL, thanks to the variety of
          talents within our team. We have sped up memory allocation,
          optimization, table joins, and row transfer routines.

   Ports
          We continue to expand our port list, this time including Windows
          NT/ix86 and NetBSD/arm32.

   Interfaces
          Most interfaces have new versions, and existing functionality
          has been improved.

   Documentation
          New and updated material is present throughout the
          documentation. New FAQs have been contributed for SGI and AIX
          platforms. The Tutorial has introductory information on SQL from
          Stefan Simkovics. For the User's Guide, there are reference
          pages covering the postmaster and more utility programs, and a
          new appendix contains details on date/time behavior. The
          Administrator's Guide has a new chapter on troubleshooting from
          Tom Lane. And the Programmer's Guide has a description of query
          processing, also from Stefan, and details on obtaining the
          PostgreSQL source tree via anonymous CVS and CVSup.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 6.5

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release of PostgreSQL. pg_upgrade can *not* be
   used to upgrade to this release because the on-disk structure of the
   tables has changed compared to previous releases.

   The new Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) features can give
   somewhat different behaviors in multiuser environments. *Read and
   understand the following section to ensure that your existing
   applications will give you the behavior you need.*
     __________________________________________________________________

Multiversion Concurrency Control

   Because readers in 6.5 don't lock data, regardless of transaction
   isolation level, data read by one transaction can be overwritten by
   another. In other words, if a row is returned by "SELECT" it doesn't
   mean that this row really exists at the time it is returned (i.e.
   sometime after the statement or transaction began) nor that the row is
   protected from being deleted or updated by concurrent transactions
   before the current transaction does a commit or rollback.

   To ensure the actual existence of a row and protect it against
   concurrent updates one must use "SELECT FOR UPDATE" or an appropriate
   "LOCK TABLE" statement. This should be taken into account when porting
   applications from previous releases of PostgreSQL and other
   environments.

   Keep the above in mind if you are using "contrib/refint.*" triggers for
   referential integrity. Additional techniques are required now. One way
   is to use "LOCK parent_table IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE" command if a
   transaction is going to update/delete a primary key and use "LOCK
   parent_table IN SHARE MODE" command if a transaction is going to
   update/insert a foreign key.

     Note: Note that if you run a transaction in SERIALIZABLE mode then
     you must execute the "LOCK" commands above before execution of any
     DML statement ("SELECT/INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE/FETCH/COPY_TO") in the
     transaction.

   These inconveniences will disappear in the future when the ability to
   read dirty (uncommitted) data (regardless of isolation level) and true
   referential integrity will be implemented.

                                 Release 6.4

     Release date: 1998-10-30

   There are *many* new features and improvements in this release. Thanks
   to our developers and maintainers, nearly every aspect of the system
   has received some attention since the previous release. Here is a
   brief, incomplete summary:

     * Views and rules are now functional thanks to extensive new code in
       the rewrite rules system from Jan Wieck. He also wrote a chapter on
       it for the Programmer's Guide.
     * Jan also contributed a second procedural language, PL/pgSQL, to go
       with the original PL/pgTCL procedural language he contributed last
       release.
     * We have optional multiple-byte character set support from Tatsuo
       Ishii to complement our existing locale support.
     * Client/server communications has been cleaned up, with better
       support for asynchronous messages and interrupts thanks to Tom
       Lane.
     * The parser will now perform automatic type coercion to match
       arguments to available operators and functions, and to match
       columns and expressions with target columns. This uses a generic
       mechanism which supports the type extensibility features of
       PostgreSQL. There is a new chapter in the User's Guide which covers
       this topic.
     * Three new data types have been added. Two types, inet and cidr,
       support various forms of IP network, subnet, and machine
       addressing. There is now an 8-byte integer type available on some
       platforms. See the chapter on data types in the User's Guide for
       details. A fourth type, serial, is now supported by the parser as
       an amalgam of the int4 type, a sequence, and a unique index.
     * Several more SQL92-compatible syntax features have been added,
       including "INSERT DEFAULT VALUES"
     * The automatic configuration and installation system has received
       some attention, and should be more robust for more platforms than
       it has ever been.

                                Release 6.3.2

     Release date: 1998-04-07

   This is a bug-fix release for 6.3.x. Refer to the release notes for
   version 6.3 for a more complete summary of new features.

   Summary:

     * Repairs automatic configuration support for some platforms,
       including Linux, from breakage inadvertently introduced in version
       6.3.1.
     * Correctly handles function calls on the left side of BETWEEN and
       LIKE clauses.

   A dump/restore is NOT required for those running 6.3 or 6.3.1. A make
   distclean, make, and make install is all that is required. This last
   step should be performed while the postmaster is not running. You
   should re-link any custom applications that use PostgreSQL libraries.

   For upgrades from pre-6.3 installations, refer to the installation and
   migration instructions for version 6.3.

     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Release 6.3

     Release date: 1998-03-01

   There are *many* new features and improvements in this release. Here is
   a brief, incomplete summary:

     * Many new SQL features, including full SQL92 subselect capability
       (everything is here but target-list subselects).
     * Support for client-side environment variables to specify time zone
       and date style.
     * Socket interface for client/server connection. This is the default
       now so you might need to start postmaster with the "-i" flag.
     * Better password authorization mechanisms. Default table privileges
       have changed.
     * Old-style time travel has been removed. Performance has been
       improved.

     Note: Bruce Momjian wrote the following notes to introduce the new
     release.

   There are some general 6.3 issues that I want to mention. These are
   only the big items that cannot be described in one sentence. A review
   of the detailed changes list is still needed.

   First, we now have subselects. Now that we have them, I would like to
   mention that without subselects, SQL is a very limited language.
   Subselects are a major feature, and you should review your code for
   places where subselects provide a better solution for your queries. I
   think you will find that there are more uses for subselects than you
   might think. Vadim has put us on the big SQL map with subselects, and
   fully functional ones too. The only thing you cannot do with subselects
   is to use them in the target list.

   Second, 6.3 uses Unix domain sockets rather than TCP/IP by default. To
   enable connections from other machines, you have to use the new
   postmaster -i option, and of course edit "pg_hba.conf". Also, for this
   reason, the format of "pg_hba.conf" has changed.

   Third, char() fields will now allow faster access than varchar() or
   text. Specifically, the text and varchar() have a penalty for access to
   any columns after the first column of this type. char() used to also
   have this access penalty, but it no longer does. This might suggest
   that you redesign some of your tables, especially if you have short
   character columns that you have defined as varchar() or text. This and
   other changes make 6.3 even faster than earlier releases.

   We now have passwords definable independent of any Unix file. There are
   new SQL USER commands. See the Administrator's Guide for more
   information. There is a new table, pg_shadow, which is used to store
   user information and user passwords, and it by default only SELECT-able
   by the postgres super-user. pg_user is now a view of pg_shadow, and is
   SELECT-able by PUBLIC. You should keep using pg_user in your
   application without changes.

   User-created tables now no longer have SELECT privilege to PUBLIC by
   default. This was done because the ANSI standard requires it. You can
   of course GRANT any privileges you want after the table is created.
   System tables continue to be SELECT-able by PUBLIC.

   We also have real deadlock detection code. No more sixty-second
   timeouts. And the new locking code implements a FIFO better, so there
   should be less resource starvation during heavy use.

   Many complaints have been made about inadequate documentation in
   previous releases. Thomas has put much effort into many new manuals for
   this release. Check out the doc/ directory.

   For performance reasons, time travel is gone, but can be implemented
   using triggers (see "pgsql/contrib/spi/README"). Please check out the
   new \d command for types, operators, etc. Also, views have their own
   privileges now, not based on the underlying tables, so privileges on
   them have to be set separately. Check "/pgsql/interfaces" for some new
   ways to talk to PostgreSQL.

   This is the first release that really required an explanation for
   existing users. In many ways, this was necessary because the new
   release removes many limitations, and the work-arounds people were
   using are no longer needed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 6.3

   A dump/restore using pg_dump or pg_dumpall is required for those
   wishing to migrate data from any previous release of PostgreSQL.

                                Release 6.2.1

     Release date: 1997-10-17

   6.2.1 is a bug-fix and usability release on 6.2.

   Summary:

     * Allow strings to span lines, per SQL92.
     * Include example trigger function for inserting user names on table
       updates.

   This is a minor bug-fix release on 6.2. For upgrades from pre-6.2
   systems, a full dump/reload is required. Refer to the 6.2 release notes
   for instructions.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 6.2 to version 6.2.1

   This is a minor bug-fix release. A dump/reload is not required from
   version 6.2, but is required from any release prior to 6.2.

   In upgrading from version 6.2, if you choose to dump/reload you will
   find that avg(money) is now calculated correctly. All other bug fixes
   take effect upon updating the executables.

   Another way to avoid dump/reload is to use the following SQL command
   from "psql" to update the existing system table:
 update pg_aggregate set aggfinalfn = 'cash_div_flt8'
  where aggname = 'avg' and aggbasetype = 790;

   This will need to be done to every existing database, including
   template1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Allow TIME and TYPE column names(Thomas)
Allow larger range of true/false as boolean values(Thomas)
Support output of "now" and "current"(Thomas)

     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Release 6.2

     Release date: 1997-10-02

   A dump/restore is required for those wishing to migrate data from
   previous releases of PostgreSQL.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 6.1 to version 6.2

   This migration requires a complete dump of the 6.1 database and a
   restore of the database in 6.2.

   Note that the "pg_dump" and "pg_dumpall" utility from 6.2 should be
   used to dump the 6.1 database.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 1.x to version 6.2

   Those migrating from earlier 1.* releases should first upgrade to 1.09
   because the COPY output format was improved from the 1.02 release.

                                 Release 6.1

     Release date: 1997-06-08

   The regression tests have been adapted and extensively modified for the
   6.1 release of PostgreSQL.

   Three new data types (datetime, timespan, and circle) have been added
   to the native set of PostgreSQL types. Points, boxes, paths, and
   polygons have had their output formats made consistent across the data
   types. The polygon output in misc.out has only been spot-checked for
   correctness relative to the original regression output.

   PostgreSQL 6.1 introduces a new, alternate optimizer which uses genetic
   algorithms. These algorithms introduce a random behavior in the
   ordering of query results when the query contains multiple qualifiers
   or multiple tables (giving the optimizer a choice on order of
   evaluation). Several regression tests have been modified to explicitly
   order the results, and hence are insensitive to optimizer choices. A
   few regression tests are for data types which are inherently unordered
   (e.g. points and time intervals) and tests involving those types are
   explicitly bracketed with "set geqo to 'off'" and "reset geqo".

   The interpretation of array specifiers (the curly braces around atomic
   values) appears to have changed sometime after the original regression
   tests were generated. The current "./expected/*.out" files reflect this
   new interpretation, which might not be correct!

   The float8 regression test fails on at least some platforms. This is
   due to differences in implementations of pow() and exp() and the
   signaling mechanisms used for overflow and underflow conditions.

   The "random" results in the random test should cause the "random" test
   to be "failed", since the regression tests are evaluated using a simple
   diff. However, "random" does not seem to produce random results on my
   test machine (Linux/gcc/i686).
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to Version 6.1

   This migration requires a complete dump of the 6.0 database and a
   restore of the database in 6.1.

   Those migrating from earlier 1.* releases should first upgrade to 1.09
   because the COPY output format was improved from the 1.02 release.

     Release date: 1996-11-04

   Sorry, we didn't keep track of changes from 1.02 to 1.09. Some of the
   changes listed in 6.0 were actually included in the 1.02.1 to 1.09
   releases.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 1.02

     Release date: 1996-08-01
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 1.02 to version 1.02.1

   Here is a new migration file for 1.02.1. It includes the 'copy' change
   and a script to convert old ASCII files.

     Note: The following notes are for the benefit of users who want to
     migrate databases from Postgres95 1.01 and 1.02 to Postgres95
     1.02.1.

     If you are starting afresh with Postgres95 1.02.1 and do not need to
     migrate old databases, you do not need to read any further.

   In order to upgrade older Postgres95 version 1.01 or 1.02 databases to
   version 1.02.1, the following steps are required:
    1. Start up a new 1.02.1 postmaster
    2. Add the new built-in functions and operators of 1.02.1 to 1.01 or
       1.02 databases. This is done by running the new 1.02.1 server
       against your own 1.01 or 1.02 database and applying the queries
       attached at the end of the file. This can be done easily through
       "psql". If your 1.01 or 1.02 database is named testdb and you have
       cut the commands from the end of this file and saved them in
       "addfunc.sql":
       % psql testdb -f addfunc.sql
       Those upgrading 1.02 databases will get a warning when executing
       the last two statements in the file because they are already
       present in 1.02. This is not a cause for concern.
     __________________________________________________________________

Dump/Reload Procedure

   If you are trying to reload a pg_dump or text-mode, copy tablename to
   stdout generated with a previous version, you will need to run the
   attached "sed" script on the ASCII file before loading it into the
   database. The old format used '.' as end-of-data, while '\.' is now the
   end-of-data marker. Also, empty strings are now loaded in as '' rather
   than NULL. See the copy manual page for full details.
       sed 's/^\.$/\\./g' <in_file >out_file

   If you are loading an older binary copy or non-stdout copy, there is no
   end-of-data character, and hence no conversion necessary.

     Release date: 1996-02-23
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 1.0 to version 1.01

   The following notes are for the benefit of users who want to migrate
   databases from Postgres95 1.0 to Postgres95 1.01.

   If you are starting afresh with Postgres95 1.01 and do not need to
   migrate old databases, you do not need to read any further.

   In order to Postgres95 version 1.01 with databases created with
   Postgres95 version 1.0, the following steps are required:
    1. Set the definition of NAMEDATALEN in "src/Makefile.global" to 16
       and OIDNAMELEN to 20.
    2. Decide whether you want to use Host based authentication.
         a. If you do, you must create a file name pg_hba in your
            top-level data directory (typically the value of your
            $PGDATA). "src/libpq/pg_hba" shows an example syntax.
         b. If you do not want host-based authentication, you can comment
            out the line:
        HBA = 1
            in "src/Makefile.global"
            Note that host-based authentication is turned on by default,
            and if you do not take steps A or B above, the out-of-the-box
            1.01 will not allow you to connect to 1.0 databases.
    3. Compile and install 1.01, but DO NOT do the "initdb" step.
    4. Before doing anything else, terminate your 1.0 postmaster, and
       backup your existing $PGDATA directory.
    5. Set your PGDATA environment variable to your 1.0 databases, but set
       up path up so that 1.01 binaries are being used.
    6. Modify the file "$PGDATA/PG_VERSION" from 5.0 to 5.1
    7. Start up a new 1.01 postmaster
    8. Add the new built-in functions and operators of 1.01 to 1.0
       databases. This is done by running the new 1.01 server against your
       own 1.0 database and applying the queries attached and saving in
       the file 1.0_to_1.01.sql. This can be done easily through "psql".
       If your 1.0 database is name testdb:
        % psql testdb -f 1.0_to_1.01.sql
       and then execute the following commands (cut and paste from here):
-- add builtin functions that are new to 1.01

create function int4eqoid (int4, oid) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function oideqint4 (oid, int4) returns bool as 'foo'

;
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Incompatibilities:
 * 1.01 is backwards compatible with 1.0 database provided the user
   follow the steps outlined in the MIGRATION_from_1.0_to_1.01 file.
   If those steps are not taken, 1.01 is not compatible with 1.0 database.

Enhancements:
 * added PQdisplayTuples() to libpq and changed monitor and psql to use it
 * added NeXT port (requires SysVIPC implementation)
 * added CAST .. AS ... syntax
 * added ASC and DESC key words
 * added 'internal' as a possible language for CREATE FUNCTION
   internal functions are C functions which have been statically linked
   into the postgres backend.
 * a new type "name" has been added for system identifiers (table names,
   attribute names, etc.)  This replaces the old char16 type.   The
   of name is set by the NAMEDATALEN #define in src/Makefile.global
 * a readable reference manual that describes the query language.
 * added host-based access control.  A configuration file ($PGDATA/pg_hba)
   is used to hold the configuration data.  If host-based access control
   is not desired, comment out HBA=1 in src/Makefile.global.
 * changed regex handling to be uniform use of Henry Spencer's regex code
   regardless of platform.  The regex code is included in the distribution
 * added functions and operators for case-insensitive regular expressions.
   The operators are ~* and !~*.
 * pg_dump uses COPY instead of SELECT loop for better performance

Bug fixes:
 * fixed an optimizer bug that was causing core dumps when
   functions calls were used in comparisons in the WHERE clause
 * changed all uses of getuid to geteuid so that effective uids are used
 * psql now returns non-zero status on errors when using -c
 * applied public patches 1-14

Changes

Copyright change:
 * The copyright of Postgres 1.0 has been loosened to be freely modifiable
   and modifiable for any purpose.  Please read the COPYRIGHT file.
   Thanks to Professor Michael Stonebraker for making this possible.

Incompatibilities:
 *  date formats have to be MM-DD-YYYY (or DD-MM-YYYY if you're using
   EUROPEAN STYLE).  This follows SQL-92 specs.
 *  "delimiters" is now a key word

Enhancements:
 *  sql LIKE syntax has been added
 *  copy command now takes an optional USING DELIMITER specification.
   delimiters can be any single-character string.
 *  IRIX 5.3 port has been added.
   Thanks to Paul Walmsley and others.
 *  updated pg_dump to work with new libpq
 *  \d has been added psql
   Thanks to Keith Parks
 *  regexp performance for architectures that use POSIX regex has been
   improved due to caching of precompiled patterns.
   Thanks to Alistair Crooks
 *  a new version of libpq++
   Thanks to William Wanders

Bug fixes:
 *  arbitrary userids can be specified in the createuser script
 *  \c to connect to other databases in psql now works.
 *  bad pg_proc entry for float4inc() is fixed
 *  users with usecreatedb field set can now create databases without
   having to be usesuper
 *  remove access control entries when the entry no longer has any
   privileges
 *  fixed non-portable datetimes implementation
 *  added kerberos flags to the src/backend/Makefile
 *  libpq now works with kerberos
 *  typographic errors in the user manual have been corrected.
 *  btrees with multiple index never worked, now we tell you they don't
   work when you try to use them

     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Incompatible changes:
 * BETA-0.3 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH DATABASES CREATED WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
   (due to system catalog changes and indexing structure changes).
 * double-quote (") is deprecated as a quoting character for string literals;
   you need to convert them to single quotes (').
 * name of aggregates (eg. int4sum) are renamed in accordance with the
   SQL standard (eg. sum).
 * CHANGE ACL syntax is replaced by GRANT/REVOKE syntax.
 * float literals (eg. 3.14) are now of type float4 (instead of float8 in
   previous releases); you might have to do typecasting if you depend on it
   being of type float8.  If you neglect to do the typecasting and you assign
   a float literal to a field of type float8, you might get incorrect values
   stored!
 * LIBPQ has been totally revamped so that frontend applications
   can connect to multiple backends
 * the usesysid field in pg_user has been changed from int2 to int4 to
   allow wider range of Unix user ids.
 * the netbsd/freebsd/bsd o/s ports have been consolidated into a
   single BSD44_derived port.  (thanks to Alistair Crooks)

SQL standard-compliance (the following details changes that makes postgres95
more compliant to the SQL-92 standard):
 * the following SQL types are now built-in: smallint, int(eger), float, real,
   char(N), varchar(N), date and time.

   The following are aliases to existing postgres types:
                smallint -> int2
                integer, int -> int4
                float, real  -> float4
   char(N) and varchar(N) are implemented as truncated text types. In
   addition, char(N) does blank-padding.
 * single-quote (') is used for quoting string literals; '' (in addition to
   \') is supported as means of inserting a single quote in a string
 * SQL standard aggregate names (MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, COUNT) are used
   (Also, aggregates can now be overloaded, i.e. you can define your
   own MAX aggregate to take in a user-defined type.)
 * CHANGE ACL removed. GRANT/REVOKE syntax added.
   - Privileges can be given to a group using the "GROUP" key word.
        For example:
                GRANT SELECT ON foobar TO GROUP my_group;
        The key word 'PUBLIC' is also supported to mean all users.

        Privileges can only be granted or revoked to one user or group
        at a time.

        "WITH GRANT OPTION" is not supported.  Only class owners can change
        access control
   - The default access control is to grant users readonly access.
     You must explicitly grant insert/update access to users.  To change
     this, modify the line in
                src/backend/utils/acl.h
     that defines ACL_WORLD_DEFAULT

Bug fixes:
 * the bug where aggregates of empty tables were not run has been fixed. Now,
   aggregates run on empty tables will return the initial conditions of the
   aggregates. Thus, COUNT of an empty  table will now properly return 0.
   MAX/MIN of an empty table will return a row of value NULL.
 * allow the use of \; inside the monitor
 * the LISTEN/NOTIFY asynchronous notification mechanism now work
 * NOTIFY in rule action bodies now work
 * hash indexes work, and access methods in general should perform better.
   creation of large btree indexes should be much faster.  (thanks to Paul
   Aoki)

Other changes and enhancements:
 * addition of an EXPLAIN statement used for explaining the query execution
   plan (eg. "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM EMP" prints out the execution plan for
   the query).
 * WARN and NOTICE messages no longer have timestamps on them. To turn on
   timestamps of error messages, uncomment the line in
   src/backend/utils/elog.h:
        /* define ELOG_TIMESTAMPS */
 * On an access control violation, the message
        "Either no such class or insufficient privilege"
   will be given.  This is the same message that is returned when
   a class is not found.  This dissuades non-privileged users from
   guessing the existence of privileged classes.
 * some additional system catalog changes have been made that are not
   visible to the user.

libpgtcl changes:
 * The -oid option has been added to the "pg_result" tcl command.
   pg_result -oid returns oid of the last row inserted.   If the
   last command was not an INSERT, then pg_result -oid returns "".
 * the large object interface is available as pg_lo* tcl commands:
   pg_lo_open, pg_lo_close, pg_lo_creat, etc.

Portability enhancements and New Ports:
 * flex/lex problems have been cleared up.  Now, you should be able to use
   flex instead of lex on any platforms.  We no longer make assumptions of
   what lexer you use based on the platform you use.
 * The Linux-ELF port is now supported.  Various configuration have been
   tested:  The following configuration is known to work:
        kernel 1.2.10, gcc 2.6.3, libc 4.7.2, flex 2.5.2, bison 1.24
   with everything in ELF format,

New utilities:
 * ipcclean added to the distribution
   ipcclean usually does not need to be run, but if your backend crashes
   and leaves shared memory segments hanging around, ipcclean will
   clean them up for you.

New documentation:
 * the user manual has been revised and libpq documentation added.

                           Postgres95 Release 0.02

     Release date: 1995-05-25
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Incompatible changes:
 * The SQL statement for creating a database is 'CREATE DATABASE' instead
   of 'CREATEDB'. Similarly, dropping a database is 'DROP DATABASE' instead
   of 'DESTROYDB'. However, the names of the executables 'createdb' and
   'destroydb' remain the same.

New tools:
 * pgperl - a Perl (4.036) interface to Postgres95
 * pg_dump - a utility for dumping out a postgres database into a
        script file containing query commands. The script files are in a ASCII
        format and can be used to reconstruct the database, even on other
        machines and other architectures. (Also good for converting
        a Postgres 4.2 database to Postgres95 database.)

The following ports have been incorporated into postgres95-beta-0.02:
 * the NetBSD port by Alistair Crooks
 * the AIX port by Mike Tung
 * the Windows NT port by Jon Forrest (more stuff but not done yet)
 * the Linux ELF port by Brian Gallew

The following bugs have been fixed in postgres95-beta-0.02:
 * new lines not escaped in COPY OUT and problem with COPY OUT when first
   attribute is a '.'
 * cannot type return to use the default user id in createuser
 * SELECT DISTINCT on big tables crashes
 * Linux installation problems
 * monitor doesn't allow use of 'localhost' as PGHOST
 * psql core dumps when doing \c or \l
 * the "pgtclsh" target missing from src/bin/pgtclsh/Makefile
 * libpgtcl has a hard-wired default port number
 * SELECT DISTINCT INTO TABLE hangs
 * CREATE TYPE doesn't accept 'variable' as the internallength
 * wrong result using more than 1 aggregate in a SELECT
