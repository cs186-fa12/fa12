Assignment 4

Put your answers in blocks wrapped by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>". Each block is
marked with TODO. Remove the TODO after putting your answer in.

If the "autograde" attribute is "yes" for a question, the question will be
marked using a grading script. Make sure you follow the instructions on the
format for the answers.

Question 1 SOME EASY STUFF

Connect to the database.  Type "\d" to see the list of relations in the
database.  Use SQL queries to examine these relations. In particular examine
the relation Rankings. Answer the following questions:
-->
<question id="1a" autograde="yes"
  text="What are the attributes of the Students relation?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. Separate the attributes by
",". For example:
id, name, gpa
]]></question>

<question id="1b1" autograde="yes"
  text="How many indexes are built on the Rankings relation?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. One Number.
]]></question>

<question id="1b2" autograde="yes"
  text="Name the indexes and write down their type?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. Use one line for each index.
Each line should start with the name of the index, followed by a comma, and
the type of the index. For example:
id_idx, btree
]]></question>

<question id="1c" autograde="yes"
  text="How many tuples are there in the Rankings relation?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. One number.
]]></question>

<question id="1d" autograde="yes"
  text="How many distinct values of state does the query planner estimate there
       are for the Rankings relation?
       (hint: Query pg_stats to find out)">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. One number.
]]></question>

<question id="1e" autograde="yes"
  text="How many distinct values of state are there actually in the rankings
        table? (hint: it's probably easiest to run a query to compute
        this!)">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. One number.
]]></question>

<question id="1f"
  text="What query did you use to find the answer to E?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. A SQL query.
]]></question>
	
<!--
Question 2 USING THE QUERY PLAN VIEWER

This question requires you to use the PostgreSQL query plan visualization
command EXPLAIN. Read the documentation for EXPLAIN at the link given above.
Note that (like System R) EXPLAIN estimates query costs in units of disk I/Os
(CPU instructions are added in by multiplying times a conversion factor).
Consider the following query:

SELECT * FROM rankings WHERE state = 'CA'; 

Answer the following questions looking at the query plan generated by the
EXPLAIN command:
-->
<question id="2a"
  text="Briefly describe the plan chosen.">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.
]]></question>

<question id="2b"
  text="In what order would the tuples be returned by this plan? Why?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.
]]></question>

<question id="2c" autograde="yes"
  text="What is the estimated total cost of running the plan?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.
]]></question>

<question id="2d"
  text="What is the estimated result cardinality for this plan? Looking at the
        statistics, why does the optimizer come up with this estimate?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.
]]></question>

<question id="2e" autograde="yes"
  text="How many colleges actually do have state = 'CA'?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. One Number
]]></question>

<question id="2f"
  text="Looking at the statistics, what are the top 5 states with the most
        colleges and the percentage of colleges in each of those state?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. Use one line for each state.
Each line should start with the two-character acronym for the state, followed
by a comma, and the percentage. For example:
CA, 24.5%
]]></question>

<question id="2g"
  text="Which value of state is actually the most popular, and how many tuples
        have that state? How did you figure this out (what query did you use)?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.
]]></question>

<!--
Question 3 SELECTS WITH INDEXES

Consider the same query from previous question: 

SELECT * FROM rankings WHERE state = 'CA'; 

Answer the following questions looking at the plans and the access methods:
-->
<question id="3a"
  text="Create a btree index on the attribute state of the relation Rankings.
        What is the plan chosen for the query now?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.
]]></question>

<question id="3b" autograde="yes"
  text="What is the estimated total cost of running the plan?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. One number.
]]></question>

<question id="3c"
  text="Compare this plan with the plan obtained in question 2.A above.
        Which is cheaper and why?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.  
]]></question>

<!--
Question 4 RANGE SELECTS

DROP the index that you created for Question 3. Don't forget to VACUUM ANALYZE
Now analyze the query plan that PostgreSQL comes up for the following query: 

SELECT * FROM rankings WHERE gradrate < 10;

Answer the following questions:
-->
<question id="4a" autograde="yes"
  text="How many ranking tuples that have gradrate &lt; 10 does the
        optimizer think there are?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO. One number.  
]]></question>

<question id="4b"
  text="In what order will the tuples be returned by this plan?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.  
]]></question>

<question id="4c"
  text="What is a value of the constant (i.e. '10' in the above query) such
        that the optimizer chooses a different plan? What is that plan and why
        does the optimizer think it will be cheaper than the previous plan when
        used with this new constant?">

Question 5 SIMPLE JOIN

Create a B-tree index on 'studentfacultyratio' of the rankings table.
Analyze the query plan for the following query that finds the average salary at
schools who have a student to faculty ratio < 5.

SELECT R.name, F.avesalary 
FROM rankings R, financials F
WHERE R.id = F.id AND R.studentfacultyratio < 5; 

Answer the following questions:
-->
<question id="5a"

<question id="5c1" autograde="yes"
  text="Disable the join type used in the above plan and re-optimize the query.
        What type of join is used now?">
<![CDATA[
TODO: Put your answer here and REMOVE THIS TODO.

<question id="5c2" autograde="yes"
  text="And what is the total estimated cost of the query?">

<!--
Question 6 THREE-WAY JOIN

DROP the index that you created for Question 5, RE-ENABLE (using "SET") the join method you turned off above, Don't forget to VACUUM ANALYZE
Answer the following questions referring to the query below:

FROM students S, rankings R, financials F
WHERE S.school = R.id and R.id = F.id;

<question id="6b"
  text="Modify the query by adding a condition R.studentfacultyratio &lt; 8.
        What is the relational algebra expression for the new join order?
